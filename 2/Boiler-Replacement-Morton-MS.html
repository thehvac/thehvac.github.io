They weren't inexpensive however a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning.
