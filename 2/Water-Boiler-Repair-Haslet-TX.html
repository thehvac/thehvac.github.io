For this reason, it is important to take note of the time and place the symptoms take place. If the signs fade or disappear when an individual is away from the house and return when the individual returns, an effort needs to be made to determine indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some effects might be intensified by an insufficient supply of outside air or from the humidity, heating, or cooling conditions common in the house.<p>
<p>In a location where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good primary heating systems. You'll want to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take control of when temperature levels reach freezing. If temperatures drop and reach listed below freezing, your heating technician can install controls which automatically shut down the heat pump. The controls will call for the furnace to come on, efficiently heating the home in these conditions.<p>
