<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating devices can last for many years. However if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel expenses all of a sudden seem greater than typical, it is most likely time to think about a new system. New heating equipment is even more effective-- you'll see lower fuel bills immediately, not to point out the money you'll minimize repair costs. If your heater is 25 years of ages or more, you can probably expect to cut your fuel bills in half.<p>

Required air heating systems also tend to create cold and hot areas throughout your home, due to the nature of how warm air increases to the top of a space and sinks as it cools.<p>
