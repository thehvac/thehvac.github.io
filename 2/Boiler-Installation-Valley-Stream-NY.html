<h3>Finding Best HVAC Contractors in Valley Stream NY</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even small window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or cleaned as conditions require. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
