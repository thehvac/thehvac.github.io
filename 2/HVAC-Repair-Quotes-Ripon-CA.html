<p>Check these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your home are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the minimized air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the issue.<p>
