<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew just what the issue was and fixed it extremely quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
