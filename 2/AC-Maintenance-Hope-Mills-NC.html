<p>Info provided in this security guide is based on present clinical and technical understanding of the issues presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders established by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. The standards do not require you to change your existing central air conditioning systems, and replacement parts and services need to still be available for your house's systems. The "lifespan" of a central air conditioning conditioner is about 15 to twenty years. Producers generally continue to support existing devices by making replacement parts readily available and honoring maintenance agreements after the brand-new standard goes into result.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
