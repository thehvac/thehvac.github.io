<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
