<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern-day a/c) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%.
