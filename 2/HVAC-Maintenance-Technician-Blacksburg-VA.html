<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace specialists often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
