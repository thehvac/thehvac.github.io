Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil.

Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the issue.<p>
