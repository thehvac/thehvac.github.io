<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have issues, they give me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
