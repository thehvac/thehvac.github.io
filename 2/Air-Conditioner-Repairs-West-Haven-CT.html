<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
