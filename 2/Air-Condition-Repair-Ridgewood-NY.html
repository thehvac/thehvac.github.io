<p>SysTech Style concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils.

It also avoids water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

All-electric boilers can accomplish as much as 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers should achieve 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers need to attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs.
