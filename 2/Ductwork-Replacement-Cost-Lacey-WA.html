<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>When we redesign or include on a room, we typically set up small integrated electric area heaters. Unlike heatpump, these systems are self-contained. They are likewise safe compared to older-style electric baseboard heating systems. They come in various types: wall-mounted systems that are excellent for small spaces like bathrooms, cove heating units that resemble baseboard heating units but are tucked safely up by the ceiling, and ceiling-mounted convected heat panels that offer a gentle sunshine-like heat from above.<p>
