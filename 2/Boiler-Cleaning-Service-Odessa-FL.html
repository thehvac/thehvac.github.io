<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are often described as just radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have actually heating elements installed in the subfloor of each space in the house, periodically linked to terminal units like baseboard heating systems. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heating.<p>

In turn, the items in the space, like furniture and people, would stay warm by virtue of the air temperature level.<p>
