The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air helps and dilutes indoor contaminants exhaust them from the house.<p>
