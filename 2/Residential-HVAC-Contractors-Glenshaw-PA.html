<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a reasonably simple to determine surrogate for indoor pollutants discharged by human beings, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are uncommonly high inside may cause occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the primary indoor source of co2 in a lot of structures. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the space temperature, and then switch it ON. To prevent straining an a/c's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
