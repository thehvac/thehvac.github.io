<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were preferred in the very first half of the 20th century, especially in commercial structures, apartment buildings and large houses. Lots of steam and radiator boiler systems set up more than 50 years ago remain operable, since the absence of moving parts makes them less vulnerable to tear and use.
