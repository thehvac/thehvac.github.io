<h3>Boiler Maintenance in Pueblo Colorado</h3>
<p>If no impurity sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists. Excessive re-circulation of air results in "stale air" conditions. Stale air has higher levels of co2 and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. Stale air may also be a problem when ventilation is not adequate to represent a boost in the number of workers in the location.<p>
<p>There are some more major threats for HVAC employees that could be potentially deadly. They can be exposed to Carbon monoxide gas which can be toxic. As HVAC professionals often come into contact with circuitry, they run the risk of being electrocuted. They can also suffer other kinds of abrasions and burns to the skin. Although there are risks associated with the job, it is generally carried out securely as long as correct care is taken.<p>
