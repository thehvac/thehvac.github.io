<p>The properties and structure of the soil in a location can impact the rate at which heat is performed through the ground. These should be considered before selecting the best design of an underground heating and cooling system. Soil with positive heat transfer properties requires less pipes to achieve the preferred underground heating & cooling result, while those with lowered thermal conductivity will need more pipelines.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The very best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Likewise they diagnosed the issue and fixed extremely quickly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Volatile organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals discharged as gases from products or processes; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could include volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water use.<p>
<p>This evaluation is for replacing a 17 year old AC with a brand-new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat. The technician who explained our alternatives did an excellent job in making certain we comprehended the advantages and disadvantages of each option. The technicians who set up the brand-new system were expert and fast, while requiring time to make certain we understood how the new system worked. Overall a first rate experience.<p>
