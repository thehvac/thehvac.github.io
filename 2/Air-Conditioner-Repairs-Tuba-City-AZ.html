<p>Irritants are materials that trigger an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants discovered in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can end up being airborne, and hence, are quickly inhaled. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you think of a group of people with asthma, the presence of feline allergen could bring on an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergies, but not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you need to look out for. First, you need to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
