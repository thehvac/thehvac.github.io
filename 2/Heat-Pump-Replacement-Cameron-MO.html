<h3>Furnace Repair Cost in Cameron Missouri</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the visit. They advised changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost however a fast web search validated WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the see or the new part.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
