Many standard units break down after simply four hours of extreme vibration screening, while the Brisk II is still going strong at 30 hours and more! The galvanized steel leading plate offers long lasting strength while long copper lines decrease vibration and, for that reason, noise too.

For some time I dismissed him but then I realized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually consider anything else except replacing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is itâ and low $ s excellent on energy conserving too.<p>
