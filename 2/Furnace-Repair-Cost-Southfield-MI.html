<p>Consumer products that contain methylene chloride consist of paint strippers, adhesive eliminators, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is known to cause cancer in animals. Likewise, methylene chloride is transformed to carbon monoxide gas in the body and can trigger symptoms related to exposure to carbon monoxide gas.

<p>A third way to decide whether your home might have poor indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air contamination. Finally, look for indications of issues with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can indicate your home might not have adequate ventilation consist of wetness condensation on walls or windows, foul-smelling or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other products become moldy. To find smells in your home, step outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether smells are obvious.<p>
<p>The primary health result associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your threat of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
