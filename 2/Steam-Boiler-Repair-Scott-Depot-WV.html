It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular examinations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the patio where the unit sits.

<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by including new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit toxins.)
