<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them till they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. If items with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent gos to, try a various dry cleaner.<p>
