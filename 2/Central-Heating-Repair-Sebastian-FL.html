In other words, sometimes the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the primary problem. While installing a separate split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal.

The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning separately for each space.

<p>We look at clues before we supply recommendations to change instead of repair a heating unit. One of the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are higher year after year, we know the unit is not running efficiently. It may be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be wasting money by not changing the older unit.<p>
