<p>Right now, countless allergen, dead skin cells, construction debris, and mold may be living in your house's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe along with the performance of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a risk to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a current study by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground. However much of the things people do-- or don't do-- can add to the stew of air-borne pollutants in their homes and worsen asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned regularly, they can end up being blocked with particles that can restrict airflow, potentially impacting your convenience and your system's performance. Filthy filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace elements and in more extreme cases trigger the system to shut down entirely. By contrast, changing a furnace and inspecting filter can generally be performed in simply a few minutes, often with no tools required. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes.
