<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
