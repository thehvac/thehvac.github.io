Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them till they have been properly dried. If products with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent sees, try a various dry cleaner.<p>
