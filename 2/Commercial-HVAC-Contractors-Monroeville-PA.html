<p>I have been utilizing them for years for my companies, my own houses and my realty clients' homes. I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with different costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again. He is honest, reliable, and sensible on rate. It's tough to discover an honest AC person and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
<p>The installation was quickly, professional and extremely well done. The installers were respectful and understood exactly what to do. I am an engineer by profession and recognize easily individuals who are proficient at what they do. I was impressed with the installers as they are great and do not miss out on information that develops a task very well done. I really highly advise the 2 gentlemen as they are outstanding at what they do. Thank you to them as they definitely deserve my thanks and gratitude for a task well done.<p>

<p>As much of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all significant devices manufacturer's to ensure your factory warranties stay in place. Furthermore, the concrete results of a PM is frequently tough to quantify, as one action mentioned the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. A lot of pieces of a furnace or a/c do not just break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the outcome of repetitive usage of a component that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might stop working too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing premature deterioration, causing cracks and holes. , if that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and secures the element.. an extremely beneficial result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
