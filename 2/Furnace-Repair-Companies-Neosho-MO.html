Radiant heat systems have actually been around because the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floorings and connected them into a hot water supply. Romans utilized a wood-fired boiler tended by slaves and an elementary pumping device to distribute hot water that warmed their stone floorings. In turn, the harmony of the flooring heat transferred heat to other short articles in the rooms, including the human residents.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that permits the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system elements, and impurity sources.
