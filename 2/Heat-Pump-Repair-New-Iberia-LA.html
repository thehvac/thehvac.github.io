<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. As soon as the circuitry is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly cure and solidify-- generally two to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you might pick to replace the outdoor compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency system.

Nevertheless, considering recent modifications in refrigerants and a/c designs, it might be wiser to replace the whole system.<p>
