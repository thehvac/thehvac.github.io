<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. When they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floors and connected them into a hot water supply, glowing heat systems have actually been around given that the days of the Romans. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and a primary pumping device to distribute hot water that warmed their stone floors. In turn, the uniformity of the flooring heat moved heat to other short articles in the rooms, including the human occupants.<p>
<p>More typical in reasonably older houses, a boiler-based heating system utilizes oil, gas or electrical power to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in specific spaces. All-electric boilers can accomplish approximately 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers should achieve 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers should achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
