<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
