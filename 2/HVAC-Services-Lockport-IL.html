<p>How climate modification affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary ac system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the ac system boost.

As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
