Instead of sending out air through hot coils, he sent it through cold coils (filled with cold water). The air was cooled, and thus the amount of moisture in the air might be managed, which in turn made the humidity in the room manageable. The regulated temperature level and humidity helped preserve constant paper measurements and ink alignment. Later, Provider's technology was applied to increase performance in the work environment, and The Carrier Air Conditioning Company of America was formed to meet rising demand. Gradually, cooling became used to enhance convenience in automobiles and homes as well.<p>

<p>The predominant health result related to exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
