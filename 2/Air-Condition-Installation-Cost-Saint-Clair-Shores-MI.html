<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
