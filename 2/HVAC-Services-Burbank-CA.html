<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical product over time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
