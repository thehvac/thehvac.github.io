<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was type of strange being that package was opened and items might have fell out. But after review of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The product was incredibly lite weight and takes some time to apply. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we dealt with concerns. I would suggest this product to anyone who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

<h3>Appropriate Things To Look Out For In Your Butner NC Commercial HVAC Service Provider</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the math recently, however I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine assessments. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their deal with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I feel like they give me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
