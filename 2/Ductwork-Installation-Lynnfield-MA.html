<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have actually been around because the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floors and connected them into a hot water supply.

If your house already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated process. If you are including on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, installing a new gas furnace system can be rather expensive.<p>
