<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives ask for assessment and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, many of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on similar principles.

In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the room.<p>
