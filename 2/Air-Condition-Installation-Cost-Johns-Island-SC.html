<p>While toxin levels from specific sources might not posture a significant health threat by themselves, the majority of houses have more than one source that adds to indoor air contamination. There can be a major danger from the cumulative effects of these sources. Luckily, there are steps that the majority of people can take both to reduce the danger from existing sources and to avoid new issues from happening. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Epa (EPA) and the U.S. Customer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to help you decide whether to do something about it that can decrease the level of indoor air contamination in your own home.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that only a qualified HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, but a homeowner does not have the tools or abilities required to examine refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and proper airflow are important to a well-functioning system, but homeowners do not have the essential equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still needed to have a specialist technician inspect the system periodically.<p>
<p>Air pollutants can vary from impurities brought in from the outdoors by your pets to harmful gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a typical air toxin arising from natural gas that gets away into your house without being burned off. Older homes may include asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In kitchens and bathrooms, mold and mildew can end up being a problem where moisture levels are typically higher than in the rest of your house.<p>
