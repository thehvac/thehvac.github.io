<h3>Air And Heat Repair in Rayville Louisiana</h3>
<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Leaky return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a difficult task that the workers sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with clients and keeps people working. When a sales man comes to your house he exists to sell, that is the only method he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and must not "require" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I provide you the alternatives for your needs and you choose if you need it.<p>
