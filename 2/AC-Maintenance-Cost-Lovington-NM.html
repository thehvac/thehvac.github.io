<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
