A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found somebody to correctly service and the unit has actually been running problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
