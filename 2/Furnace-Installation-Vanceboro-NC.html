<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to look out for. First, you need to inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
