<p>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals given off as gases from items or processes; for the a lot of part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
