<p>Professional heater installations. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating system will eventually stop working. HVAC specialists recommend following this fundamental guideline when choosing whether it's worth buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the price of a new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>
<p>Oil heaters are less common now than gas, but they can be helpful in more remote regions where energies are harder to gain access to, and in chillier climates due to the fact that it supplies more heat per BTU than other solutions. The installation cost will be lower, however energy expenses will be higher, as much as 3 times higher than gas or electric heaters. They require a storage tank on the instant property and more maintenance. Overall, they cost between $2,000 and $8,000 to install. Overall, they offer an AFUE score of between 80 and 90 percent.<p>
