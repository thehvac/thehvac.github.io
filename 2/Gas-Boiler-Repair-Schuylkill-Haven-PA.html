<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Proper ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same pollutants. Simply put, often the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heating systems, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by distributing warm water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

In turn, the objects in the room, like furnishings and individuals, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>
