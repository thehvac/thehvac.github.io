<p>Discover PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects toxins from indoor air (expressed as a portion effectiveness rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (expressed in cubic feet per minute).

The long-term performance of any air cleaner depends on maintaining it according to the producer's instructions.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are built.

When radon becomes trapped in concentrations and buildings build up inside your home, direct exposure to radon ends up being an issue.<p>

If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
