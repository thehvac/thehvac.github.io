<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, houses and workplaces matters, particularly because we spend most of our lives inside. Air conditioners assist to dehumidify the inbound air, but in incredibly damp environments or in cases where the a/c is large, it might not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioning unit will require more energy to cool your house. A more effective alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>
<p>When you need to have a new air conditioner set up or are ready for a replacement system, call the NATE-certified AC installation specialists at Integrity Energy Systems for dependable installation service.
