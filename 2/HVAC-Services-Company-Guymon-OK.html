<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn In Your Air Conditioner in Guymon OK</h3>
<p>The remainder of the HVAC system also needs to be in leading condition for the a/c unit to work well. This includes the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which reside inside the house. If the private parts remain in appropriate order, the technician can take a look at the ductwork for indications of holes, spaces or excessive dirt. Sealing leaks in ductwork can improve HVAC efficiency by as much as 30 percent, and provide for a cooler house in the hot summertime.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
