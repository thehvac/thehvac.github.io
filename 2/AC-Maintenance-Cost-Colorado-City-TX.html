<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a recommendation later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4).

Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
