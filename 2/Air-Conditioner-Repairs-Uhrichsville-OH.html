<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance and Tune-Ups in Uhrichsville Ohio</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>When our furnace was dying, we called two local companies for quotes. While both were useful and helpful, Ballard Gas gave us a better deal, for exceptional service. Rather than an easy sales task, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heater and situated methods we might have more even heat. He included these considerable however small adjustments in his quote. Since of current warmer summertimes and for environmental reasons, we chose to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
<p>Many HVAC technicians frequently find themselves working in uneasy and confined spaces, at severe heights, and often in hazardous conditions like extreme weather (to service outdoor heatpump and heat exchangers).
