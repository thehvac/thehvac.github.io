<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. Gradually, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Prior to that takes place, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid more damage to your system.<p>
