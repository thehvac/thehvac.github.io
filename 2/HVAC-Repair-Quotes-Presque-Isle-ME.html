<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, workers attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more troubles, because a few of indoor units can be located far from the exterior.
