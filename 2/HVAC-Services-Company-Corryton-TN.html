<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then determine the height and width of the opening. When shopping for an air conditioner to guarantee it'll fit comfortably into the window, be sure to have those dimensions on hand.

<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ might notice undesirable or moldy odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are getting worse, talk to your doctor about them. But not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to great building management.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in enough outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
