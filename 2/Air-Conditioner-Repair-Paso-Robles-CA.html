<p>The world's leading all-in-one software for residential and commercial HVAC organisations. HVAC technicians are subject to a variety of potentially dangerous conditions.

<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat increases, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level.

All objects in the hot zone reach balance in temperature level after the radiant heat system has actually been operating for a while, including people. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace begins and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>

The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
