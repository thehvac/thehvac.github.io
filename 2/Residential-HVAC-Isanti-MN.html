<p>Prior to you head out and buy an air conditioning unit, there are a couple of things to decide initially. Where are you going to be setting up the a/c unit? If your home is not equipped with ductwork, do you want to install some or go ductless? How big should the air conditioning unit be?

Too little and your air conditioner will not be able to cool the house correctly. These are simply a few of the aspects that you require to take into account when looking for a brand-new AC system.

<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more tough to manage than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity should be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>

The two operations use different procedures, with geothermal energy needing water be warmed to boiling point to accomplish its objectives.<p>
