<h3>The Way to Maintain Healthy Ductwork for A Healthy Home in Batavia IL</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, carried out a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, determined particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
