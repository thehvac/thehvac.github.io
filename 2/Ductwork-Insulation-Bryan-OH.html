<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
