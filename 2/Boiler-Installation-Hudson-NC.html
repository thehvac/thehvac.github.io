<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace at Hudson NC</h3>
<p>Biological contaminants: the biological contaminants can consist of germs, viruses, fungi (mold), allergen irritant, animal dander, insect bio detritus, fibers and fiberglass, pollen, cockroach allergen, and so on. and may result from insufficient maintenance and house cleaning, water spills, insufficient humidity control, condensation, or may be brought into the building by occupants, seepage, or ventilation air. Allergic reactions to indoor biological pollutant direct exposures trigger symptoms in allergic people and also play a crucial role in triggering asthma episodes for an estimated 15 million Americans.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
