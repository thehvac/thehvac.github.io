<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Lunenburg MA</h3>
<p>A hydronic glowing flooring heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipelines set up under the flooring or right within the floor surface area itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the floor mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other posts with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and individuals. It does not depend on heating or moving air to move warmth.<p>
<p>There's a big difference between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common type of home heating-- convection. Over the previous century, most of houses in colder climates were warmed by convection, rather than radiation. Convection is the process of heating air and blowing it about the spaces for the warm air to keep the walls, ceilings and floorings heated up. In turn, the objects in the room, like furniture and people, would stay warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>
