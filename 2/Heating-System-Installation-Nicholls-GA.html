<p>EHSI's indoor air quality group excels in incorporating a multidisciplinary technique to indoor air quality (IAQ) challenges.

<p>If your a/c is more than eight years old, repair is probably not worth the expense, unless it's an easy problem like particles blocking the condenser unit or a used fan belt. Still, to finest weigh your repair-or-replace decision, ask your contractor to assess not just the condition of your existing equipment, but likewise the ducts that deliver the cool air and the overall quality of the insulation in your home.

Call a pro-- you have actually got more severe concerns if it blows once again.<p>
