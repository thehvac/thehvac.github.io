<p>The quality of the air inside our homes, offices and schools matters, especially since we invest most of our lives inside.

<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c unit works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
