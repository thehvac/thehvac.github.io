<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act just like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most budget-friendly. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to install an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>It might feel comfortable being sealed in tight against the cold in your home during the chillier months of the year, but for individuals who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have respiratory issues, winter can exacerbate problems.
