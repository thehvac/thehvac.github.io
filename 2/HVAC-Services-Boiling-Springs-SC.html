<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the space temperature level, and then change it ON. To avoid straining an ac system's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
