<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Ada OK</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on various house performance upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took ample time to help us debate which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest savings. We never ever felt hurried and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's services and products was remarkable.

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a reference in the future). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
