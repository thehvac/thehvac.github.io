<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside system as near your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work.

He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
