<p>I generally don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not expect needing to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
