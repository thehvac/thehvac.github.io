<p>, if the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't offer contracts.. The so called reputable companies swindle more people than the fly by night attire. I know due to the fact that I tried to work for them. I stop since 90% of them are crooks. They walk in with or without a contract and start selling you things you don't require. They lie.

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
