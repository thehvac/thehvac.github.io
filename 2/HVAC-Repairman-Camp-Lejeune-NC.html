<h3>Heating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Repairing Needs in Camp Lejeune NC</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his evaluation, guaranteeing I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>My eldest kid constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him however then I understood that it truly didnâ $ t disperse air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really consider anything else except changing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The sound level is itâ and low $ s great on energy conserving too.<p>
