<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act similar to standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most economical. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to set up an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
