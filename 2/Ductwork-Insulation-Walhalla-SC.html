<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that might impact the health of individuals who live in the home. Contaminants might come from outside the home-- such as an idling vehicle engine in a connected garage, yard trash burning, or radon going into your house from the ground below. An air pollutant could also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a defective furnace, unstable organic substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or personal care products. Bacteria and infections, pet dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
