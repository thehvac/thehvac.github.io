<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you should examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
