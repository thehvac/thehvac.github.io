<h3>Facts All Marshall MO Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, conducted a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance.
