<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical material in time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
