R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be bought and used by qualified HVAC service technicians. For systems requiring only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by many people.<p>
