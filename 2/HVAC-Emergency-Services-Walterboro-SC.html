<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost terrific however Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more enhanced.

<p>You're most likely hearing the fan motor trying to start without the boost it requires from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can usually conclude that the capacitor has stopped working. Sometimes you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the chances are great that this might work for one cycle, but the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's best to change the capacitor.<p>
