<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts years, given that it is secured indoors. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical guidelines get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat over time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>
