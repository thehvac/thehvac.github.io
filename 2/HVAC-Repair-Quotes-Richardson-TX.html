Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was definitely appreciative to have a heated house again. What's most fantastic was that this all occurred during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to assist us right prior to a holiday, but Climate Pro came through for us. I will happily advise this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your house will not warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
