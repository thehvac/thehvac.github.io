The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>There are many aspects to consider when choosing a new furnace. Trust our experienced specialists to set out all your choices. We'll visit your house for a comprehensive examination, including an analysis of your existing ductwork and floorplan to discover the very best system for your home.
