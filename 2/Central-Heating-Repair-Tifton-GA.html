<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor unit as near to your home as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work.

He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
