<h3>Furnace Installation Cost in Crowley TX 76036</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
