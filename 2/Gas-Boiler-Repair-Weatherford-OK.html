There are several design techniques in usage today; however, all ground source heat pumps operate with similar principles. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop in between the surface area systems and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth.

All-electric boilers can accomplish up to 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers should accomplish 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers must accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
