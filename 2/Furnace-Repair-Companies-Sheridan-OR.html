When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat.

<p>EER means Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions.
