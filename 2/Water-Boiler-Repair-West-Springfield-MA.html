The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. A ducted heat pump system might be most cost effective if your home or structure has an existing duct system that remains in good shape. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
