<p>A geothermal heatpump is likewise an extremely safe heating and cooling service, since it does not need any type of combustion, unlike options. This makes the WaterFurnace geothermal system a much better choice for those who are worried about safety, both in regards to individuals and the environment, with geothermal solutions using an environmentally friendly energy source for heating and cooling homes.<p>
