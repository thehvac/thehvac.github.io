<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical product with time.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
