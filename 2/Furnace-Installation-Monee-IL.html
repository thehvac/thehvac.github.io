<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not only was the cost excellent but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
