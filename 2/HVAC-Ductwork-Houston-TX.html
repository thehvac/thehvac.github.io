It safeguards the environment from damaging digging, fracking, or pollutants due to the fact that the energy utilized to heat your house is extracted directly from the ground.

<p>A/c can also be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
