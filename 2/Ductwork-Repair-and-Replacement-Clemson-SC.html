Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

More serious than a lot of allergenic residential or commercial properties is the ability of mold to trigger episodes personallies that already have asthma, a severe breathing disease.<p>
<p>Legionella is a parasite of protozoans such as amoeba, and hence needs conditions ideal for both organisms. The bacterium forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, including chlorine.

Preventive measures consist of changing normal warm water levels to permit 120 ° F( 50 ° C )at the tap, evaluating center style layout, eliminating faucet aerators, and periodic testing in suspect locations.<p>

<p>The homes and structure of the soil in a location can affect the rate at which heat is performed through the ground. These should be considered before choosing the best design of an underground cooling and heating system.

<p>For each load of laundry you dry, that moisture needs to go somewhere. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just requesting for mold buildup, states Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a simple and effective  technique to reduce ambient air pollution and possible health dangers, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>
<p>Typically the most effective method to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be gotten used to reduce the quantity of emissions. In most cases, source control is likewise a more cost-efficient approach to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your home are listed later on in this section.<p>
<p>Humid and moist conditions breed mold and mildew that can trigger respiratory concerns like allergies and asthma. Depending upon your area, the hot summer months can cause particularly humid conditions.
