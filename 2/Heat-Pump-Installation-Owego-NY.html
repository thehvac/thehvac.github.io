<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Issues in Owego NY</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are very effective, due to the fact that ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature level is always at a constant temperature. These systems can obtain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just achieve a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Just like other types of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). COP rates just how much heat a system removes or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling result. Many ground source heatpump have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for each unit of energy utilized by a geothermal heat pump, roughly 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
