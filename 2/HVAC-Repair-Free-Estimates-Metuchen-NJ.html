<p>While toxin levels from private sources may not posture a significant health threat on their own, most homes have more than one source that contributes to indoor air pollution. There can be a major risk from the cumulative results of these sources. Luckily, there are steps that the majority of people can take both to lower the risk from existing sources and to prevent brand-new problems from taking place. This security guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Item Security Commission (CPSC) to help you decide whether to do something about it that can lower the level of indoor air pollution in your own house.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The best thing about G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they diagnosed the issue and repaired very quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your home's square video. They use a series of estimations based upon the British Thermal Units or BTUs needed to heat the space.
