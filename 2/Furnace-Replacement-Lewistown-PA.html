<p>Rather of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. A ductless system has a built-in performance benefit because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Since they don't need any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Since a system is set up in each space or location you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>
