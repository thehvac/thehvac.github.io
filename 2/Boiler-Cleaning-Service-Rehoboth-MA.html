<p>How environment modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c increase. This boost has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump, as well as all other kinds of heat pumps, have actually efficiencies ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency, or COP. It's a scientific way of figuring out just how much energy the system moves versus how much it uses. Many geothermal heat pump systems have Polices of 3.0 to 5.0. This suggests for every system of energy utilized to power the system, three to 5 units are provided as heat.<p>
