<h3>Air Condition Service in Girard OH 44420</h3>
<p>I typically do not leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
