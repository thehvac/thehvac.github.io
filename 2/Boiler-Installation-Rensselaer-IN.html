<p>Discover PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects pollutants from indoor air (revealed as a percentage effectiveness rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (revealed in cubic feet per minute). A really efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-term performance of any air cleaner depends upon keeping it according to the producer's instructions.<p>
