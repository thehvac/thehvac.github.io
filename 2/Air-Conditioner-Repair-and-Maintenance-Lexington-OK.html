<h3>Have Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Lexington OK</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>

<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me concerning an abnormally high expense that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he knew that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of concern. Ron had actually identified the problem location in looking over the bill. He solved the issue in one day, had changed the expense to what I thought about reasonable before he called back, understood what might have caused the problem and had a plan to guarantee that it would not occur once again. I have considered All Points a company with integrity for the 9 years we have actually used them. This experience validates that.<p>
