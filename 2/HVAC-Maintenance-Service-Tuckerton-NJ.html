<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, providing warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
