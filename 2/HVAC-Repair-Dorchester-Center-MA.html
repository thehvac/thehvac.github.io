<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your house that ideal temperature level throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing some of those common air toxins. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can cause pricey repairs down the road. So, make sure to change your AC filters frequently, or get an air conditioning service plan which normally includes a filter modification - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Think about possible results of indoor air pollution if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heating system.

While an area heater is in use, open a door from the space where the heating system is located to the rest of the home and open a window a little.<p>
