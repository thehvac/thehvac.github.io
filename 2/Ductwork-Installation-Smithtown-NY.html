<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you must watch out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
