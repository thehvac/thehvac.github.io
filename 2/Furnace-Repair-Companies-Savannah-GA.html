<h2>How To Hire HVAC Contractor in Savannah</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How climate modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for contemporary ac system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit increase. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The ac system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
