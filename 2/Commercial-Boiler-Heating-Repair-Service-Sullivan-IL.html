<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do not accept them till they have been appropriately dried. Try a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>

To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator requires handled by professionals, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
