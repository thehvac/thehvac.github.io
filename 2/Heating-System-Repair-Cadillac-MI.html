<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms heated by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot next to the radiators. This normally leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up the house escape out of the window. Radiant heat provides warmth from the floor up throughout the room with no cold areas or stuffiness in the area being warmed.<p>

For a long time I dismissed him however then I realized that it truly didnâ $ t distribute air like it did previously.
