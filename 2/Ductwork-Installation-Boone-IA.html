Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not offer car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to use automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement..
