<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct.
