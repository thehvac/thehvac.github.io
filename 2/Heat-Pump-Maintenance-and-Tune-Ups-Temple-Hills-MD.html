Heat pumps work on electrical energy and work like a/c unit in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This allows them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a basic electric heating system (like an area heating unit) with the same amount of electricity. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<h3>Boiler Maintenance in Temple Hills MD - Reasons Why You Would Have to Reset The Boiler</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current pattern in house building is to reduce air leakage through fractures and other openings in roofings, walls, and floors. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor contaminants and helps tire them from the home.<p>

<p>The predominant health effect connected with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your risk of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
