<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or lab environments, rather than outside or industrial settings. In jobs where union subscription is not an issue, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC system, and installing the ductwork in the building. It might likewise consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to private areas.<p>

The decision to repair or change is up to you, and frequently it refers comparing the cost to repair, taking into account the age of the equipment, versus the cost of a brand-new furnace that likely offers higher energy efficiency and comes with warranty coverage.<p>
