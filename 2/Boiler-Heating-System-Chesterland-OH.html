<h3>Ductless Heat Pump in Chesterland Ohio</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of visible growth or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and examine. Leaky return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
