<p>As with the majority of house improvement jobs, the cost of a complete central heating unit can differ extensively based on the size of the home. Most heaters will last in between 15 and 20 years.

Heat output is determined in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace need to be matched to the size of the home. A small house, for example, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the house too quickly and shut off for too long, resulting in irregular temperature levels.<p>
