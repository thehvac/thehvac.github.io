<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your house's square video footage. They utilize a series of calculations based upon the British Thermal Systems or BTUs required to heat the area. The larger the area, the more effective the house heater needs to be. For already constructed house heating systems, the contractor will need to get rid of the old furnace to add the brand-new one. These charges will be consisted of in the installation costs.<p>
