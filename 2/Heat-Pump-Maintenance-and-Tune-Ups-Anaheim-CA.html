Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the walls, ceilings, or floors covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioner to the home. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Learn how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
