Sometimes there is a moldy odor however mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can flourish in covert or seldom accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products consisting of carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Repair the wetness issue, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely clean the area using recognized health department suggestions.<p>
