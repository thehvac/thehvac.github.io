<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as an Essential Organisation in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are rated 90% effectiveness or much better; it is not uncommon for a contemporary furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older designs, which might be ranked as low as 80% effectiveness, this can indicate significant cost savings in annual heating expenses. Modern two- and three-stage heaters increase effectiveness even further by performing at lower or greater capability depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your house won't warm up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A filthy filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
