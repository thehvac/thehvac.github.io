<p>Keep in mind that the SEER rating is determined using the exact same set of temperatures across the board. The average summer season temperature level to reach the SEER ranking is 83 degrees, so to get to the proper SEER ranking for your location, subtract 2 points for every 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER ranking needs to be at least 13 for all brand-new a/c units produced in the United States.<p>
<p>The bureau jobs 34 percent employment growth for HVAC service technicians between 2010 and 2020, more than twice the average for all occupations. A number of factors contribute to this, including the replacement and upgrade of older air conditioning systems to meet stricter ecological policies.

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of processes which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a building." Those processes include bringing in outdoors air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the building, and moving some portion of indoor air outside. The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
