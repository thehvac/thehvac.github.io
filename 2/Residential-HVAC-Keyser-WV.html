<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
