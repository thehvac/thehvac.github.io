<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>Its unique feature is the existence of one primary external system that connected to numerous indoor units. Such systems might be the best solution for keeping the microclimate in a number of workplaces, stores, big living spaces. Simply few of outdoor systems do not aggravate the aesthetic appearance of the structure. The main external unit can be linked to a number of various indoor types: floor, ceiling, cassette, etc<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for home occupants. Unlike other kinds of air conditioning unit, evaporative coolers depend on the outdoors air to be carried through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its duct system; this cooled outside air should be permitted to push the warmer air within your house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically basic to understand and keep.<p>
