<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
