<p>Excellent Product! Delivery was type of weird being that package was opened and items might have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we assured it was all intact. The product was very lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: purchase advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we solved problems. I would advise this product to anyone who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the very first time.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
