<p>Unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals given off as gases from processes or items; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently harmless as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could consist of unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within throughout water usage.<p>
<p>The predominant health result connected with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your risk of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
