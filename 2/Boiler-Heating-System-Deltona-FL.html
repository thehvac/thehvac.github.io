<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
