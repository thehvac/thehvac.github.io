<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment.

<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace issues.

If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter.

So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
