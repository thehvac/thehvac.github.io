<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as simply radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating elements installed in the subfloor of each space in the home, periodically connected to terminal systems like baseboard heating systems. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heating.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a referral in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
