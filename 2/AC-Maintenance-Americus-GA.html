Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the minimized airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
