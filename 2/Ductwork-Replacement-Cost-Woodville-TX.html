<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of visible development or a musty smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and keep. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

<h3>Choosing Commercial HVAC Repair Services at Woodville TX</h3>
<p>The majority of people do not understand how humidity is eliminated from your Houston Midtown Tx house. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic likewise acts a dehumidifier. All the moist hot air that goes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then removed from the area that is being cooled.

To prevent straining an a/c's compressor, wait at least five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You ought to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
