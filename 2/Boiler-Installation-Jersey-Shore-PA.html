<p>EER stands for Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ may see musty or unpleasant smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems.
