<p>We often install small built-in electric area heaters when we redesign or include on a space. Unlike heatpump, these units are self-contained. They are likewise safe compared to older-style electric baseboard heating systems. They can be found in many different forms: wall-mounted units that are fantastic for small areas like restrooms, cove heating units that are similar to baseboard heaters but are tucked safely up by the ceiling, and ceiling-mounted convected heat panels that supply a gentle sunshine-like heat from above.<p>
