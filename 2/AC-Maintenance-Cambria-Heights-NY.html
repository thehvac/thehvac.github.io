<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me concerning an unusually high bill that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had actually called the service supervisor and left a message of issue. Ron had actually identified the difficulty location in looking over the costs. He dealt with the concern in one day, had actually adjusted the costs to what I considered fair prior to he called back, understood what may have triggered the issue and had a strategy to guarantee that it would not happen once again. I have thought about All Points a company with stability for the 9 years we have utilized them. This experience validates that.<p>

He clearly and completely discussed all issues and repairs in a way that made me confident in his capability to fix my repair issues.

He likewise responded to my call right away the next morning, and coached me through a short-term fix to a problem that could not be fixed on the first go to due to unavailable parts.
