<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs.
