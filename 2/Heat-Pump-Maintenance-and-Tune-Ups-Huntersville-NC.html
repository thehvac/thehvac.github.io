<h3>AC Repair Contractor in Huntersville NC 28078</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>

<p>Air contaminants can vary from pollutants generated from the outdoors by your pets to harmful gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a common air pollutant arising from natural gas that escapes into your home without being burnt. Older homes might include asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when launched into the air. In cooking areas and bathrooms, mold and mildew can become an annoyance where moisture levels are normally greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For instance, people breathe out carbon dioxide, which in little amounts is not toxic, but might end up being dangerous if high concentrations are allowed to build up. Micro-organisms or bacteria may also be present within the ventilation system. They may spread throughout the entire office or structure by means of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
