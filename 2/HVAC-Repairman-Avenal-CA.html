We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same pollutants. To put it simply, in some cases the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>
<p>The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is committed to supplying a workplace that is free of acknowledged threats and to investigation complaints that might be connected to bad indoor air quality (IAQ). Though particular policies have not been developed for IAQ in the work place, the Environment, Health and Safety Department (EHS) considers recommendations from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE).<p>

<p>Initially, in regards to perks, heating the entire house or structure from one system makes things simpler logistically, and the isolation of the heating unit from the living space is a bonus for some house owners.

<p>Just like the majority of home improvement jobs, the cost of a complete central heating unit can differ widely based upon the size of the house. A lot of heaters will last in between 15 and 20 years. In picking a furnace, property owners should consider heat output and efficiency. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the home. A small home, for example, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the house too rapidly and turn off for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature level levels.<p>
