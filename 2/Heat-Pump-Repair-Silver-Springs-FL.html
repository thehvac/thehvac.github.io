<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as an Important Company in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are rated 90% effectiveness or much better; it is not uncommon for a modern-day furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older designs, which might be rated as low as 80% efficiency, this can suggest considerable cost savings in annual heating costs. Modern two- and three-stage heating systems increase performance even further by performing at lower or greater capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air, a ductless system, or a heat pump, everything requires to be replaced ultimately. As devices ages, it ends up being less effective.

If your system is near, or past, its anticipated life-span, replacement may be the most economical option.<p>
