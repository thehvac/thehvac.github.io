<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the primary issue. While setting up a separate split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system creates more problems, since a few of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems operate separately from each other.<p>
