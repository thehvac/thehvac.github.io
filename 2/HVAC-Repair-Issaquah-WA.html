<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
