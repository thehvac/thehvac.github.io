<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>The function of the majority of structure ventilation systems is to bring in sufficient fresh air for occupant convenience while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and constructing safety at reasonable energy expenses. Load calculating is referred to as the Handbook J estimation and should be carried out by the HVAC contractor before giving an installation or system cost for air conditioning. Move to another contractor if your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning system you require based on experience or on square video footage alone. Just like measuring the size of a system required based upon BTUs, determining the correct size of unit for your house also depends upon the unit load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump can be quickly integrated with existing systems such as standard forced air or radiant floor heating or can be installed in a new building.

The size of geothermal heatpump and the size of ground loop needed depends on the heating & cooling requirements for your house and is important iin ensuring the efficiency and performance of the system. Capacity for geothermal systems is measured in lots. Generally, a 3-ton setup needs to suffice for the average home, but home size, heating and cooling requirements, local geology and soil, and land accessibility are all aspects which will influence the proper size for your particular house. Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heat pump installation and can help you effectively size a system.<p>
