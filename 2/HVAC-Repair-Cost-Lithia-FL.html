<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, however it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be quite considerable.<p>
