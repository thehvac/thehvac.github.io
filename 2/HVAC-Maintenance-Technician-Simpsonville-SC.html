<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices usually lasts years, since it is safeguarded inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical standards eliminate the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years back and understand the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
