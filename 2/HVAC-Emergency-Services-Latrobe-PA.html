<p>Proper ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same pollutants. Simply put, sometimes the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate terrific but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

All bids (get at least three, from accredited, well-regarded companies) should include this one-page hard copy.<p>

<p>Before cooling or installing any brand-new heating system in a home, it is necessary to re assess and reduce the energy load of the house. A more energy effective house will not only minimize the cost of a new system and energy costs, but it will greatly enhance the convenience of your home. Prior to we style and install any systems, we set up a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will advise improvements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these improvements. Basic enhancements typically consist of adding insulation and air sealing procedures. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can recommend numerous certified house Energy Star auditors and installation experts. Please Contact Us for referrals.<p>

<p>If you require furnace operate in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else could come other than for SW.
