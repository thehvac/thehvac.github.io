Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your home via ducts, and cool air is gathered via cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for effectiveness. Older systems from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion procedure. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated procedure. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite pricey.<p>
