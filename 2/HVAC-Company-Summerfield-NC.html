<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that just a skilled HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can result in pricey compressor failure, but a homeowner does not have the tools or skills essential to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and correct airflow are essential to a well-functioning system, however property owners lack the necessary equipment for the job. The bottom line?
