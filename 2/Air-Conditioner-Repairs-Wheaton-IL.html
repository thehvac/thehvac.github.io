<p>Radiant heat covers a series of different heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

<p>Outdoor contaminants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a home, outdoor particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and irritants discovered in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems efficiently filters particulates. Experts advise utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, but higher MERV levels trap smaller particles and usually are better for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>
