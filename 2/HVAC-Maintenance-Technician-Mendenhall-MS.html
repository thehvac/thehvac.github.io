<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area.

Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage.
