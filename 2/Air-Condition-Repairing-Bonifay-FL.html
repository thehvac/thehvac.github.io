<p>A packaged unit, usually installed on the roofing system, is most typically used on commercial structures, but it is also an alternative for property owners to consider. Many times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those looking to conserve money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system independently, considering that the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are usually just readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be a good way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best option for house owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
