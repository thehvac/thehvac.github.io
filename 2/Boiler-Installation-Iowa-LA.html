At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than essential.<p>
<p>The lifespan of a central air conditioning unit is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioners are more energy effective than models made even 5 years earlier, so it makes monetary sense to replace or update your system if it's five years of ages or older. The very best central air conditioner you can buy today will use 30-50% less energy than one bought in 1975 while providing the same amount of cooling.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
