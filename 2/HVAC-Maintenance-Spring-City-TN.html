Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve).

If the valves on the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the standard water heater can be turned off totally.<p>
