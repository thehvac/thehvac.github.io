Many common building materials used prior to 1975 contain asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating unit, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Generally, substantial releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the building products are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure renovation. Elimination of asbestos-containing products is not always optimal due to the fact that the fibers can be spread out into the air throughout the elimination procedure. A management program for intact asbestos-containing materials is often advised instead.<p>
