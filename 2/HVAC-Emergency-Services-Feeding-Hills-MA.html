<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single see, or you can sign up for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and cooling company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance sees annually, plus another service call, a discount on parts, and generally some other benefits. Some companies use top priority consultations to their maintenance strategy members.<p>
