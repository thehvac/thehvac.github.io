This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
