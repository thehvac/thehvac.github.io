The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health recognized insufficient ventilation as the main problem in majority the work environment indoor air investigations it has actually performed. Examinations carried out in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have discovered the same to be true. These examinations revealed that correct ventilation is necessary in maintaining excellent indoor air quality.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.
