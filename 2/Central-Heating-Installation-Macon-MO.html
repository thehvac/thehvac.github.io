<p>Lots of people will require a brand-new heating unit sooner or later. Even the very best equipment ultimately stops working or technology advances up until now as to make using older heating units too costly.

<p>The heatpump gained popularity in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heatpump can draw out heat from various sources, such as ecological air, exhaust air from a building, or from the ground. Heat pumps move heat from outside the structure into the air within. At first, heat pump HVAC systems were only used in moderate environments, however with improvements in low temperature operation and decreased loads due to more efficient homes, they are increasing in popularity in cooler climates.<p>
<p>We have been exceptionally happy with Integrity's equipment (Trane dealer) and service (today Braxten finished yearly maintenance of our system). Trane heat pump has actually worked effectively and is so efficient that it substantially reduced our energy expenditures - the system will spend for itself in less than 5 years. The few times we require them for emergency situations they responded quickly and fixed the problem.<p>
