The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it collects pollutants from indoor air (expressed as a portion efficiency rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering aspect (revealed in cubic feet per minute).

<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the main issue. While installing a separate split system, workers try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more troubles, given that some of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the a/c separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>
