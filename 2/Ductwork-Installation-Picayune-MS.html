<p>Excellent Item! Delivery was sort of strange being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was very lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we fixed issues. I would advise this product to anyone who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol result, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from badly placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which may go into neighboring ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and assisted living home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outdoor fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
