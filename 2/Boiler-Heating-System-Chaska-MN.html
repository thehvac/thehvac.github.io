<h3>Fixing Your Boiler in Chaska MN</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by improving airflow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, measured particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
