<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Aside from area heating, the geothermal heating system can also be connected to a device known as a geothermal desuperheater.

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, but it is typically used as a surrogate for air quality and building tenancy level. The more residents there are in a space or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have a negative effect on occupants-- outside air must be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
