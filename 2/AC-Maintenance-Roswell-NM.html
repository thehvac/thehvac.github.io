<p>All Points Heating offers house a/c, air conditioning system installation, a/c maintenance that deliver trusted, proven efficiency at high efficiency. Combustion products from auto exhaust, furnaces, hot water heater, space heating units, fragrant candles, oil lamps, wood stoves, fireplaces, and gas stoves that are not appropriately vented can produce carbon monoxide gas, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates. These combustion products may lead to nose, throat, and eye irritation; fatigue; lightheadedness; and nausea.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price great but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
