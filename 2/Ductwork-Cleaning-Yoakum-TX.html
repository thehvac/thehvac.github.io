<p>Expert heating unit setups. However, even the best-maintained heater will eventually stop working. HVAC experts recommend following this basic guideline when deciding whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a brand-new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>
<p>The first air conditioning unit and refrigerators used hazardous or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could result in fatal accidents when they dripped.

The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
