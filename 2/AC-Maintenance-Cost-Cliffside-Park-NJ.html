<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or two. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to removing the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Image 6).<p>

<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, managing the power to the heating wires and also managing the temperature level of the flooring. All circuitry for your radiant heat system either runs to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is unobstructed and dry.<p>
<p>Terrific service within 24 hr and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and extremely extensive in discussing what services would be performed. Likewise Camryn supplied fantastic client service at the end of the consultation by explaining exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of suggestions of some maintenance jobs we may want to have performed in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale techniques used by some in the market.<p>
