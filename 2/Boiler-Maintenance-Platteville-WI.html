<p>If you think a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a moldy odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and maintain. Leaking return ducts can likewise present wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Numerous HVAC business owners do not realize they need various rates plans for different services that their company offers. For example, residential HVAC installation must be priced in a different way from commercial HVAC installation, and an HVAC service need to be priced in a different way from duct cleaning. If you are providing more than one service, you should separate these into various departments, as if they were their own different service.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil change in your vehicle. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter better traps impurities and particles in the air. Energy Star recommends replacing your filter when every three months. Throughout high use months, inspect the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
