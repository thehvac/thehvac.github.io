<p>Sean was really practical. He is a very enjoyable person to work with. No pressure applied to buy extra stuff. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the space temperature level, and after that change it ON. To avoid straining an a/c's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
