Water can likewise puddle around the system or flood the area. To deal with condensate problems, please see Air conditioning unit Leaks Water, listed below.<p>

Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage.
