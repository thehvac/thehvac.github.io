<p>We take a look at ideas before we provide advice to replace rather than repair a heater. One of the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy.

For example, a heat exchanger might fail too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature deterioration, resulting in fractures and holes. If that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and protects the part.  a really useful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
