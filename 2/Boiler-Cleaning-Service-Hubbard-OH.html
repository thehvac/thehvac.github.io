<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Leaky return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Our indoor air quality specialists can convert your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center. To reduce pollutants, we suggest installing innovative air cleaning systems like MicroPower Guard filters, which are developed to remove the smallest particles from the air. The OxyQuantum UV sanitation systems also help control germs and natural smells. Many store-bought filters can not eliminate these smallest of allergens and do not get rid of gases and germs.<p>
