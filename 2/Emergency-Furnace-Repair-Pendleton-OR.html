<h3>Locating Greatest HVAC Contractors in Pendleton OR</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

So, be sure to alter your AC filters routinely, or get an a/c service plan which typically includes a filter change - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
