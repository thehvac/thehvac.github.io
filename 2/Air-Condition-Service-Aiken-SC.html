<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material with time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
