<p>Reality: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth.

<h3>HVAC Service in Deming NM 88030</h3>
<p>I usually don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't expect needing to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
