<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. A ductless system has an integrated efficiency advantage because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leaks in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions due to the fact that they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be set up. Due to the fact that a system is installed in each space or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy.
