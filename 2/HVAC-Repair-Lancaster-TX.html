<h3>How to Receive Your HVAC Certification and HVAC Licensing in Lancaster TX</h3>
<p>Sean was really practical. He is an extremely pleasant person to work with. No pressure used to buy extra things. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no concerns besides the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
