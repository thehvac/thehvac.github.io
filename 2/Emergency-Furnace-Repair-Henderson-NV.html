The EPA study recommended and controlled techniques used on a smaller sized number of homes.

<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping between an indoor and outside  system instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor system. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>I highly recommend using this service. Very trustworthy exceptionally nice. Looked after a part that was not covered under guarantee fast and efficient and did not have to pay an arm and a leg to get it done. Terrific company started by a guy who is wanting to grow his business and secure his household. He installed a total system inside and out. Excellent unit and a great price. I am currently on the maintance plan. He takes care of it twice a year with out needing to be reminded to do it.<p>
