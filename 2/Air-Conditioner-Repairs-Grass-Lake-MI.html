<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. When they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floors and tied them into a hot water supply, radiant heat systems have been around since the days of the Romans. Romans utilized a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and a primary pumping machine to circulate warm water that warmed their stone floorings. In turn, the harmony of the flooring heat transferred heat to other posts in the rooms, including the human residents.<p>
<p>A SEER rating stands for Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER rating of a system is the cooling output at varying temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the same duration. Basically, SEER offers more information based upon how the EER carries out in various temps. The greater the system's SEER ranking, the more energy efficient it is. 1 An unit's SEER rating can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all devices.<p>

<p>Air conditioning unit can create a great deal of water because they remove wetness from the air. To eliminate this, they have a typically plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work.

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that may impact the health of individuals who live in the home.
