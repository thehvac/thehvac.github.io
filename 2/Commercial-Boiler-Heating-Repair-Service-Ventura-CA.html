<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical product gradually.
