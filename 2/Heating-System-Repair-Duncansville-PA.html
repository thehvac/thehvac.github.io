<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it collects contaminants from indoor air (expressed as a portion performance rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering aspect (revealed in cubic feet per minute).

The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends on preserving it according to the producer's directions.<p>
<p>The impacts of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young children can be severe. They include delays in mental and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
