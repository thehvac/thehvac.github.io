<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and likewise regulating the temperature of the flooring. All circuitry for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entryway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the location is unobstructed and dry.<p>

<p>Next, and possibly just as important when it pertains to central air costs, is the AC system's size.

<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is often essential to figuring out the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such information can sometimes be obtained by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the employer. If monitoring information is not offered, yet a high number of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union representative should request that the company have air monitoring tests conducted. Evaluation of this data might determine potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are really low, monitoring information might not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
