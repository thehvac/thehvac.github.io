<h3>HVAC Maintenance Near Me in Klamath Falls OR 97603</h3>
<p>I have been using them for several years for my services, my own houses and my realty customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with various costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again, he helped me problem shoot the problem. He is sincere, reputable, and affordable on price. It's difficult to discover an honest AC person and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
