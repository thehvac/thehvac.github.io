<p>Due to the fact that an a/c unit moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both need to be kept tidy. This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
