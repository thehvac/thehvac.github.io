Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
