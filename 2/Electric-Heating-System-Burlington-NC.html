<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is typically greater than many heat pump options, they can still be extremely efficient, depending on the model you buy. Among the main benefits of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to higher temperature levels than other heating options. This implies it can warm up your home to the desired temperature level quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
