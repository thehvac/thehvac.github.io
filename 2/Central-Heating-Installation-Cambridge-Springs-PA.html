Consult your state's contractor's licensing board online to guarantee that no consumer grievances have actually been submitted which the heating and air-conditioning contracting license is active and valid.

<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things first. Make sure all the signs up in your house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the decreased air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>

<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
