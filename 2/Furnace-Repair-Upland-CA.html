A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC unit than a smaller sized house, which will affect installation expenses. Likewise a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other aspects that can impact this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into homes through dirt floors, fractures in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains pipes, and sumps. Direct exposure to radon ends up being a concern when radon becomes trapped in structures and concentrations build up inside your home.<p>
