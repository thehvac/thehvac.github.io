<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently described as simply radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating components set up in the subfloor of each room in the house, sometimes linked to terminal units like baseboard heating systems. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the technique is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
