<p>Frequently, indoor air quality problems in large commercial structures can not be successfully recognized or corrected without a comprehensive building examination. These examinations may start with composed questionnaires and telephone consultations in which building detectives assess the history of occupant symptoms and structure operation procedures. In many cases, these inquiries may quickly uncover the issue and on-site visits are unneeded.<p>
