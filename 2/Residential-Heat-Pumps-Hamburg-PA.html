A multi-split system 56 is a standard split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and permits cooling or heating of a number of rooms with one external unit.

<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside system as close to the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
