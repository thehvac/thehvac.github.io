<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost excellent however Mark went out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
