<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should momentarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
