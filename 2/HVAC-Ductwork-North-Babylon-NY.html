<h3>Ductwork Replacement Cost in North Babylon NY 11703</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
