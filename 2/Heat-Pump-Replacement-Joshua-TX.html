The system runs quietly and efficiently, but to have two significant components fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Some health effects may appear shortly after a single exposure or duplicated exposures to a pollutant.
