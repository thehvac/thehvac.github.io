<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of different heater, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the room.<p>
