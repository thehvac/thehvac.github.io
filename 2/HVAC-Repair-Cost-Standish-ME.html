<p>The split system is the most typical. Many people are used to seeing this type in the yards of homes. With split system units, the majority of the parts are housed in a metal box beyond the house. However, there are some internal elements also. Split systems are ideal for cooling multiple rooms at once, but are not extremely energy effective.
