<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures via natural and mechanical ventilation.

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly the same physical product with time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
