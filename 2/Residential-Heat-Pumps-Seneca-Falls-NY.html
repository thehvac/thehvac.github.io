<p>Many people are ending up being more concerned and mindful about their health and the effect of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt containing allergens and toxins can cover the cooling ductwork with time. Periodically it should be eliminated to refresh the quality and improve of indoor air and enhance the cooling.

<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, providing warm air to private bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
