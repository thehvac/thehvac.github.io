<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation banned making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>

<h3>HVAC Repair And You - What You Need to Know in Ashland WI</h3>
<p>The majority of people are aware that outdoor air contamination can affect their health, however indoor air pollution can also have substantial, hazardous result. EPA studies of human exposure to air pollutants show that indoor levels of contaminants may be 2 to 5 times-- and occasionally more than 100 times-- higher than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board consistently rank indoor air contamination amongst the top five environmental health threats to the general public.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance products that just an experienced HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, but a property owner doesn't have the skills or tools needed to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and proper air flow are essential to a well-functioning system, but property owners do not have the necessary devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still necessary to have a specialist technician check the system regularly.<p>
