<h3>Replacing Your Boiler in Berwick PA</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing trend in house construction is to decrease air leak through cracks and other openings in walls, roofs, and floorings. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor pollutants and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
