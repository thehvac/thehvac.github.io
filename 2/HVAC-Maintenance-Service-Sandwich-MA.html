<p>A radiator is the part of your vehicle that keeps the engine cool and protects it from extreme heating. To be cool, the radiator needs to remain clean - constantly. With time, sludge, rust and other solid deposits build up inside your car's radiator. These make the cooling system become stopped up and less reliable. This in effect injures your lorry's efficiency. A routine radiator flush suffices to keep the system in shape. For this factor, make radiator flushing a part of your routine cars and truck maintenance schedule. For all your radiator flush needs, call 206-523-2133 or check out Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
