<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not offer off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can happen with time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work up until you purchase a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
<p>Depending on where in the United States your house lies, the local region's climate can change drastically. A house located in the South would need an AC system with a size capable of cooling your house due to high temperature Summers. A house in the Northern part of the United States would require a much larger heating capacity too which will impact expenses. See the chart listed below for the average central air conditioning conditioner replacement expenses by LOTS.<p>
