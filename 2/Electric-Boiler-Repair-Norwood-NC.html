<p>The likelihood of immediate responses to indoor air toxins depends upon a number of factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two essential influences. In other cases, whether an individual responds to a pollutant depends on specific level of sensitivity, which varies enormously from individual to person. Some people can become sensitized to biological contaminants after duplicated exposures, and it appears that some individuals can become sensitized to chemical contaminants also.<p>
<p>A 3rd way to decide whether your home might have bad indoor air quality is to take a look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air pollution. Lastly, look for indications of problems with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can suggest your house may not have sufficient ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, stinky or stuffy air, unclean central heating and air cooling devices, and areas where books, shoes, or other products become musty. To detect smells in your home, step outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether smells are visible.<p>

Diagnosing ill structure syndrome is tough since numerous illnesses can cause these signs. Incredibly high levels of some impurities, such as carbon monoxide gas, can cause more major illness, including death.<p>
