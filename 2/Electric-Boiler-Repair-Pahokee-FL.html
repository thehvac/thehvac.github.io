<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance at Pahokee FL</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
