<p>Discover PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it gathers pollutants from indoor air (expressed as a portion performance rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (revealed in cubic feet per minute). An extremely effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-term performance of any air cleaner depends upon maintaining it according to the producer's instructions.<p>
<p>Cleaning the air inside your house is more crucial now than it ever has been. Starting with the energy crisis of the 1970s, new building homes have actually become better insulated to avoid the escape of heated or cooled air. These air-tight, energy-efficient homes also seal in dust, dirt, pollen, mold, skin flakes, bacteria, and other air-borne contaminants. These contaminants choose your furnishings, your woodwork, and even in your lungs. Plus, problems like poor humidity can promote the development of mold, create skin and hair issues, and a host of other unfavorable problems. Your indoor air quality is directly associated to the overall convenience and security you experience in your home, so making sure that your air is healthy and safe is big deal. The good news is, our knowledgeable air quality team can help you recognize and correct any issues with your air quality, and set up high quality items to help you take pleasure in cleaner, more secure air in your home.<p>
