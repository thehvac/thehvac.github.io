<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.

There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this.
