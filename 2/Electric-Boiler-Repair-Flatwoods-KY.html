<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The objective is to offer adequate changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical component essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
