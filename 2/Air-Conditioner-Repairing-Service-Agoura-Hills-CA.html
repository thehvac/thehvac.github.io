<p>While pollutant levels from private sources may not pose a considerable health risk by themselves, many homes have more than one source that adds to indoor air contamination. There can be a severe risk from the cumulative impacts of these sources. Luckily, there are actions that most people can take both to lower the risk from existing sources and to prevent brand-new problems from happening. This security guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to help you decide whether to act that can reduce the level of indoor air pollution in your own home.<p>
