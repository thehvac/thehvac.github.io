<p>There are numerous sources of indoor air pollution in any house. These consist of combustion sources such as oil, gas, kerosene, coal, tobacco, and wood items; building products and home furnishings as varied as deteriorated, asbestos-containing insulation, wet or damp carpet, and cabinetry or furniture made of specific pressed wood items; items for family cleaning and maintenance, personal care, or pastimes; central heating and cooling systems and humidification gadgets; and outdoor sources such as radon, pesticides, and outside air pollution.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they utilize air to exchange heat, in the exact same method as a vehicle radiator or typical family a/c unit does.

It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outside air.<p>
