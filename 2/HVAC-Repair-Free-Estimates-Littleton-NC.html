<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets ask for assessment and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. The possibility of immediate responses to indoor air toxins depends upon numerous aspects including age and preexisting medical conditions. In some cases, whether a person responds to a contaminant depends on specific level of sensitivity, which differs greatly from person to person. Some individuals can become sensitized to chemical or biological toxins after repeated or high level direct exposures.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas. Radon gas enters houses through dirt floors, fractures in concrete walls and floorings, flooring drains, and sumps. Exposure to radon ends up being an issue when radon ends up being caught in structures and concentrations develop up inside.<p>
