<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the main issue. While installing a separate split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more difficulties, considering that a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the a/c individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
