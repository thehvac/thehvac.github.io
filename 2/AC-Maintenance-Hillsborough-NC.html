<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Hillsborough NC Home Owners</h3>

Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>

<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years earlier and know the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, often referred to as central air" or split-system air conditioning", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the floors, walls, or ceilings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the ac system to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it circulates through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Discover how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
