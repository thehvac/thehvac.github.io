<p>All houses require efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from usage. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the right temperature level. Furnaces that kick on frequently may be due to a dirty filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a dirty burner.<p>
