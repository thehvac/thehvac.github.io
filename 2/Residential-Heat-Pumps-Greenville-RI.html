Pushed wood products made for indoor use consist of: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furnishings); wood plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops).
