Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no problems aside from the blower motor. The only factor he might not install the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
