<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning On Your Lathrop CA Home</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  unit instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor system.

Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
