<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
