<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his staff members, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, especially if the goal of owning a company was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it required to build business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't the end objective. HVAC business owners need to pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the same in all other locations.<p>
