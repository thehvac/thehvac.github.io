<p>We're investing a lot more time inside, these days. While many people assume pollution is simply an outside problem, your house (and workplace) can also be contaminated. As a society, we ensure that our houses are well-insulated and well-sealed, however we do not think sufficient about exposure to all the things we put in our homes," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and structures has a huge result on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, queasiness-- right away, they can come on years after exposure, according to the federal Epa (EPA). Here's how to breathe simpler.<p>
<p>The most unsafe asbestos fibers are too little to be noticeable. After they are breathed in, they can accumulate and remain in the lungs. Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (irreparable lung scarring that can be deadly). Signs of these diseases do not show up until several years after direct exposure began. Most people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to raised concentrations on the task; some industrialized disease from direct exposure to clothing and equipment brought home from task websites.<p>
