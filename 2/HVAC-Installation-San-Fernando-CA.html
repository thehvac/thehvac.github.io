<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in San Fernando CA</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing pattern in house building and construction is to minimize air leakage through fractures and other openings in roofs, floorings, and walls. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air assists and waters down indoor impurities tire them from the home.<p>
