<p>I generally don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss options. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
