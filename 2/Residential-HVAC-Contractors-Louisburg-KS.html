<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Learn More About PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends on how well it gathers contaminants from indoor air (expressed as a portion efficiency rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (revealed in cubic feet per minute). A very effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate however a less efficient collector. The long-term performance of any air cleaner depends on maintaining it according to the manufacturer's directions.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
