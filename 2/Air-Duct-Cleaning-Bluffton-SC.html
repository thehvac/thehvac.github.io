<p>The very first air conditioning unit and fridges employed toxic or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might lead to fatal accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and building comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts years, since it is protected inside. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical guidelines remove the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground in time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>
