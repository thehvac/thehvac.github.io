<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with regular preventive maintenance, however, there will constantly be the odd issue that occasionally turns up. When you do notice your furnace behaving strangely, it is very essential that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as soon as possible.

<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically described as merely glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating aspects installed in the subfloor of each space in the house, periodically connected to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the method is described as radiant heat.<p>
