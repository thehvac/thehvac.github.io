<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit toxins.) Nevertheless, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious aspect impacting indoor air quality, but it is frequently utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there are in a room or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing too expensive-- which can have a negative effect on residents-- outdoors air needs to be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
