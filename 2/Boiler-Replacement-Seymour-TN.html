<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely handy in gathering info on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to briefly deal with the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and provided clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future avoidance.
