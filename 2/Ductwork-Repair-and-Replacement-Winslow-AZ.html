Ventilation gets rid of undesirable smells and excessive wetness, presents outside air, keeps interior building air flowing, and prevents stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>Old heaters frequently do not have the capability to hydrate and clean the air in your home. Your home air might feel stuffy or stale. Does anyone in your household suffer from allergies to airborne dust, mold, pollen, viruses or dander? Or does anybody struggle with dry nose, dry throat, or dry skin?
