<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance and Tune-Ups in White River Junction VT 05001</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not expect having to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
<p>Excellent service within 24 hr and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was really extensive and on-time in explaining what services would be carried out. Also Camryn supplied excellent customer care at the end of the appointment by discussing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of recommendations of some maintenance tasks we may wish to have done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale strategies employed by some in the industry.<p>
<p>Air toxins can range from contaminants generated from the outdoors by your pets to harmful gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air contaminant arising from gas that gets away into your house without being burnt. Older houses may consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when released into the air. In restrooms and kitchen areas, mold and mildew can end up being an annoyance where moisture levels are generally higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
