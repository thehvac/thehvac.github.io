<p>Information provided in this safety guide is based on current clinical and technical understanding of the problems provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional limits established by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. Structures continuously develop as a result of the modifications in the environment around them in addition to the residents, products, and activities within them. The various surfaces and the air inside a building are continuously communicating, and this interaction leads to modifications in each. For instance, we may see a window as changing slightly with time as it ends up being dirty, then is cleaned up, builds up dirt once again, is cleaned up once again, and so on through its life. In reality, the dirt" we see may be developing as a result of the interactions amongst the moisture, chemicals, and biological products found there.<p>
