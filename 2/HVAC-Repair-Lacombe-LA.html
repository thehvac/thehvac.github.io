<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtering. From one of the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all need some fundamental maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne contaminants streaming through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping reduce the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from accumulating on internal components like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas stoves can cause levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with poorly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings through mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
