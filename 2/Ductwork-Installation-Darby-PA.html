<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide must be calibrated frequently, and outside measurements used for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors may also be needed.<p>
