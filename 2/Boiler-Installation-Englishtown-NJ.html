Others were almost two times the quantity Protex priced quote for low end off brand equipment. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up group was respectful of my house and set up the equipment in the expected amount of time. post set up assessment results look great for braising and pipes quality. New system cools far better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 unit it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
