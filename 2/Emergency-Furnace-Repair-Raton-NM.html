<p>Radiant heating covers a series of different heating unit, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on similar principles.

When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
