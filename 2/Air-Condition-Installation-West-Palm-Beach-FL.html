<h3>Advantages of Purchasing on Gas Furnaces in West Palm Beach FL</h3>

These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions require.

Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation.
