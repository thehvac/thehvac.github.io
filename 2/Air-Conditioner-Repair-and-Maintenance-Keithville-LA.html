<p>The primary health effect related to exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your danger of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
