<h3>Furnace Repair Companies in Tabor City NC 28463</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

From furnaces and a/c unit to indoor air quality systems and peripheral smart accessories, we can supply you with the product or services you require for a system you can depend on all year round.
