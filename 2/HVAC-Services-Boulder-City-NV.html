<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, but it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be rather considerable.<p>

Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage.
