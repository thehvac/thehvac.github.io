<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then measure the height and width of the opening. Be sure to have those measurements on hand when purchasing an ac system to ensure it'll fit comfortably into the window. Likewise, keep fire security in mind when choosing where to install the a/c unit: Do not position it in an egress window that works as the only means of escape should a fire erupt.<p>
