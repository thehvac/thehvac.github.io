The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure.

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then measure the height and width of the opening. When going shopping for an air conditioner to guarantee it'll fit easily into the window, be sure to have those measurements on hand. Also, keep fire security in mind when deciding where to install the a/c unit: Do not place it in an egress window that serves as the only methods of escape ought to a fire erupt.<p>
