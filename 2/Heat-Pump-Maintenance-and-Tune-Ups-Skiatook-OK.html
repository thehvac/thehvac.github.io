<p>Because they eliminate moisture from the air, Air conditioners can develop a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a generally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location. To deal with condensate problems, please see A/c Leaks Water, below.<p>
