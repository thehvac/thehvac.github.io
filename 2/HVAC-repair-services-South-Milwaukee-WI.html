<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a large central air conditioner system that sits outdoors your house. Heatpump work on electrical power and work like air conditioners in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.

<p>Particular immediate results resemble those from colds or other viral illness, so it is frequently challenging to determine if the symptoms are a result of exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is very important to focus on the time and location the signs take place. If the signs fade or disappear when an individual is away from the home and return when the person returns, an effort must be made to recognize indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some impacts might be intensified by an insufficient supply of outside air or from the humidity, heating, or cooling conditions common in the home.<p>

<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the task based only on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the couple of affordable ones got. Others were almost two times the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up team was considerate of my house and set up the devices in the expected amount of time. post install assessment results look excellent for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 system it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
