<p>The probability of immediate responses to indoor air pollutants depends upon numerous elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important impacts. In other cases, whether an individual responds to a pollutant depends upon specific level of sensitivity, which differs enormously from person to person. Some people can become sensitized to biological contaminants after repeated direct exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical toxins too.<p>
<p>Allergens are products that trigger an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens discovered in indoor air are mostly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can end up being airborne, and thus, are quickly inhaled. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For example, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the presence of cat allergen could cause an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergies, but not in those individuals who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>

She didn't need a air purification system, however they talked her into it.<p>
