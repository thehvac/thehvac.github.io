<p>All homes need effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has been burnt out from usage. Another possible factor might be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adjusting to the right temperature level. Heating systems that kick on often may be due to a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal issue.
