<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heating unit, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on similar concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by distributing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each space.

As a society, we make certain that our houses are well-sealed and well-insulated, however we don't think sufficient about exposure to all the things we put in our homes," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and buildings has a huge effect on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea-- immediately, they can begin years after direct exposure, according to the federal Epa (EPA). Here's how to breathe much easier.<p>
