<p>There are two primary forms of glowing floor heating, or RFH as it's understood in the home heating service. One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then distributed through a piping system under the floor surface. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the floor are forced to resist existing, which then creates heat.<p>
<p>We take a look at clues prior to we supply advice to change instead of repair a heater. One of the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy bills are higher year after year, we understand the system is not running effectively. It might be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more effective model, then you would be losing money by not replacing the older unit.<p>
