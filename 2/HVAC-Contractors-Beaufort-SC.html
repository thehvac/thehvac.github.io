<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Design, Construction and Commissioning is developed for designers, style engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other professionals worried about indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home include structure materials, smoking cigarettes, family products, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene space heating units.
