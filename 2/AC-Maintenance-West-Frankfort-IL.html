<p>Correct ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the same toxins. Simply put, in some cases the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>
<p>A/c unit manufacturers typically make rugged, high quality items. Start by checking any merges or circuit breakers if your air conditioner fails. Let the system cool down for about five minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limit switch might have tripped; reset it by pushing the button, located in the compressor's access panel.<p>
