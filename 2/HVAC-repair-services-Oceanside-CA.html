<p>Geothermal heatpump cost is far more than other heat pump types when installing the entire system. Geothermal systems require underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy. Setting up one involved excavation, running hundreds of backyards of piping, burying the loop, and more. This procedure is rather pricey. Installing a brand-new geothermal heatpump to work with an existing ground loop is far more affordable.<p>
<p>Many HVAC systems now have programmable thermostats that allow homeowner to control the temperature level and set it on a schedule. For example, you can set the thermostat to lower the heat when you're not in house to conserve money on the energy expenses and guarantee the system isn't overloaded. An expert technician will examine the thermostat throughout the annual maintenance to make sure the real temperature level and the temperature on the thermostat matches.
