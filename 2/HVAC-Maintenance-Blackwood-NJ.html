<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  system instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct manage air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Oil heaters tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a lot of soot, which needs to be appropriately vented and cleaned from the furnace regularly. Change the filters occasionally and have your ductwork cleaned because the soot builds up inside the ducts, lowering their efficiency gradually. Expect to service your furnace annual at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
