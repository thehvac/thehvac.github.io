The selection of indoor units has one restriction: their total power must not surpass the capacity of the outside unit.

Simply put, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that some of the spaces may not have a really comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the overall power is not simple, since it takes into account not just the small power of the systems, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and building comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
