Sources of VOC contamination from outside might include volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within during water use.<p>
<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around fixing the issue, all the while discussing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working properly. He had to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
