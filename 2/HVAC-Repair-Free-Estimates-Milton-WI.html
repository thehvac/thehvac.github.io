<p>Unstable organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from items or processes; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.
