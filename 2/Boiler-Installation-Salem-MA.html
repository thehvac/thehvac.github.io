<p>As many of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment manufacturer's to guarantee your factory service warranties stay in place. Additionally, the tangible outcomes of a PM is typically tough to measure, as one reaction mentioned the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or ac system do not simply break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the result of repetitive usage of a part that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely since the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing premature degeneration, leading to fractures and holes. , if that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and secures the component.. an extremely beneficial result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
