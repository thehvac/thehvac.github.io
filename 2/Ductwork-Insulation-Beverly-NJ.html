<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material over time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
