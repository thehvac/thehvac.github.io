Though only 33 percent of Seattle real estate units had air conditioning in 2015, more than 46,000 brand-new real estate units have been integrated in the four years since or are currently under building and construction.

<p>Energy performance can be improved a lot more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heating unit. Zones are controlled by multiple thermostats. In water heating unit the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they control zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the flow of air. In this case, the control system is very crucial to keeping a proper temperature.<p>
