Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has actually enjoyed the single-family home installation business completely turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to up to 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not just with beginners more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are lastly giving in, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
