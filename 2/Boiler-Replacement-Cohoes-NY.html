<p>An undersize unit will not be able to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate since it has to run longer than a properly sized unit. A large-scale compressor also costs more to run due to the fact that it simply takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the room can feel damp and clammy.<p>
