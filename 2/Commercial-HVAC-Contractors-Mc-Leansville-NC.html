<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have 2 separate units (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems might be adjusted to offer heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the ac system into a heatpump While space cooling supplies optimum versatility, when utilized to cool numerous spaces at a time it is typically more pricey than central air.<p>
