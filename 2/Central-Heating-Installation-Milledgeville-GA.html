<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the visit. They advised changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost but a fast web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning.

<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems in Milledgeville GA - The Benefits</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  system rather of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Many aspects impact IAQ. These factors consist of poor ventilation (absence of outside air), issues controlling temperature, low or high humidity, current renovation, and other activities in or near a building that can impact the fresh air entering into the structure. In some cases, particular pollutants like dust from building or renovation, mold, cleaning supplies, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (including small amounts of chemicals released as a gas over time) might cause bad IAQ.<p>
