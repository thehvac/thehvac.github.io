Harmful exposures to lead can be created when lead-based paint is poorly removed from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning.

<p>A lot of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c works but your home does not cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
