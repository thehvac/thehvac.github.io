Move to another contractor if your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning system you require based on experience or on square video alone. Just like determining the size of a system needed based upon BTUs, determining the proper size of system for your home also depends upon the unit load-- how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you may not have an issue as long as your home still heats to the right temperature. The temperature level of the air produced by the heat pump will not necessarily be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel really hot. If your home is not heating up, just be concerned. However, if your system does not appear to be working properly, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice.
