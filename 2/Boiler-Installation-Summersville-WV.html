<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>

<p>Volatile organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors.

Typical sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is often vital to identifying the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such info can sometimes be obtained by requesting copies of air monitoring information from the company. If keeping an eye on data is not offered, yet a high variety of health signs have actually been reported, the Union agent must request that the employer have air tracking tests performed. Review of this information may identify potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when contaminant concentrations are very low, keeping track of information might not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
