<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat.

Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively solidify and cure-- usually two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
