PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two separate systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and allows each space to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioning unit into a heatpump While space cooling offers maximum versatility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is usually more expensive than central air.<p>
