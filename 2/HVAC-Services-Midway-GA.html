After two years, things started to alter. There have actually been awkward sounds. I got it repaired and inspected. I am hoping that is the end of the issue. Overall, it has actually been a good experience. Dependable on the whole. Cool operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its appearances in the start. But then realized A/cs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
