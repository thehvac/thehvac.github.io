<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not offer them.. Second of all like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat customers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to properly service and the system has been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
