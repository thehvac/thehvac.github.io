<p>Asthmatic children are specifically at threat. EPA estimates that direct exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and intensity of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children, and might trigger countless nonasth-matic kids to establish the illness each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition intensified by direct exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Exposure to previously owned smoke triggers eye, throat, and nose irritation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have actually connected direct exposure to previously owned smoke with the start of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Info Clearinghouse (IAQ INFO), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
