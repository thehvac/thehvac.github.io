<p>Geothermal heating is one of the most effective heating sources in regards to environmental expenses. Since the energy utilized to heat your home is extracted straight from the ground, it secures the environment from harmful digging, fracking, or contaminants. Geothermal systems use compressor and evaporator systems similar to those used in fridges. While geothermal systems do utilize some electricity, they release far less greenhouse gases or other contaminants than heater that need natural gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>This is especially notable, as gas ranges can cause levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with badly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
