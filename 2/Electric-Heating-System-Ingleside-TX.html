<p>I have been using them for years for my services, my own homes and my property customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. When I called and he recommended me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again, he helped me trouble shoot the problem. He is truthful, reputable, and reasonable on rate. It's tough to find an honest AC person and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
