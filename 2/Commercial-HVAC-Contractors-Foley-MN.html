<p>These men have actually been great. At a real estate agent, I in some cases require contractors to give me a viewpoint for what deal with a house may cost. Just recently I needed to get in touch with these people two times. They came out quickly and provided me a no nonsense price quote for the work. Even when it was news my client probably wouldn't wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the sincerity. Integrity isn't just their name, it's an organisation model they take seriously. You guys are officially on speed dial. Speak with you quickly.<p>
<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the performance and performance of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, choose your contractor sensibly, a lot of the 'reputable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales tactics that DO make the most of uninformed property owners.

While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a reputable company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
