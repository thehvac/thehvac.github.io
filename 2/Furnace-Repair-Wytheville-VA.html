<p>How environment change affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c increase. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
