When you do notice your furnace acting strangely, it is very crucial that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as quickly as possible.

<p>When trying to figure out how frequently I should change my air conditioning filters, there are numerous things to take into consideration. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 home has a special DNA on how it builds up dust and dirt. It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how often your air conditioning filter gathers dirt and dust. After that, you can make a better ideal decision on how frequently your HVAC filters require replacing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less frequently you'll have to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with just one air conditioning filter require replacing more frequently.<p>
