<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets ask for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. However, a lot of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
