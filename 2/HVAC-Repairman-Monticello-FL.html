<p>Central air is a high-end not everyone can afford, many Seattleites must find ways to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service.

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material over time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
