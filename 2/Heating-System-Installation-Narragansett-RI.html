<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, workplaces and houses matters, especially considering that we invest the majority of our lives inside your home.

Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioner will require more energy to cool your house. A preferable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>

<p>If your a/c unit is more than 8 years old, repair is most likely not worth the expenditure, unless it's an easy problem like particles clogging the condenser unit or a used fan belt.
