<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
