The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it gathers pollutants from indoor air (expressed as a portion effectiveness rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (revealed in cubic feet per minute).

The long-lasting efficiency of any air cleaner depends on maintaining it according to the manufacturer's directions.<p>
