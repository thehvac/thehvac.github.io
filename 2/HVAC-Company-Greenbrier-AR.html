They're priced reasonably, have managed the one repair I needed well, and are professional and always on-time. Have been through a couple of companies over the years and Wachoff's is certainly the very best I have actually had the chance to deal with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has actually been fantastic.<p>

Set up unions at the tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed.<p>
