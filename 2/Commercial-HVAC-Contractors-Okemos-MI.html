Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>When setting up the entire system, geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types. Geothermal systems need underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy.
