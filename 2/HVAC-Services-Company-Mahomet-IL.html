<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside unit as near your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was type of unusual being that package was opened and products might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The item was incredibly lite weight and requires time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we solved concerns. I would recommend this product to anybody who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the very first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Mahomet IL</h3>
<p>I admit I haven't done the math lately, but I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine examinations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I seem like they offer me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
