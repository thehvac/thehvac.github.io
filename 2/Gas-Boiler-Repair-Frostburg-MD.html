<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.
