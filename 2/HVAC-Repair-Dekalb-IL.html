Due to the fact that the energy used to heat your home is drawn out directly from the ground, it protects the environment from damaging digging, fracking, or toxins. Geothermal systems use compressor and evaporator systems comparable to those utilized in fridges. While geothermal systems do utilize some electricity, they launch far fewer greenhouse gases or other contaminants than heating unit that require natural gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
