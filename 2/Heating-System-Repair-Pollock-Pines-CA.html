During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. However, a number of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
