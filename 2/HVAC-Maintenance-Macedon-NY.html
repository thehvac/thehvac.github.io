<h3>Recognizing the Importance of HVAC Systems at Macedon NY</h3>

From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
