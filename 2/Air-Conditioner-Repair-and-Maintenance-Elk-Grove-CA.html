From the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some basic maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne contaminants flowing through your system. They can likewise keep your system performing well by helping reduce the accumulation of dust, dirt and other particles from collecting on internal components like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
