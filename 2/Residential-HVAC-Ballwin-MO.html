Pushed wood items made for indoor use include: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furnishings); wood plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiber board (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops).
