<p>A customized a/c unit that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, however differs from a standard ac system in that both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the very same air path. A basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside.
