The minimum SEER score needs to be at least 13 for all new cooling units produced in the United States.<p>
<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>A 3rd method to choose whether your home might have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, search for indications of problems with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can show your home may not have adequate ventilation include moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or smelly air, filthy central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other products become moldy. To detect smells in your home, step outside for a couple of minutes, and after that upon reentering your house, note whether odors are noticeable.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, providing warm air to private bed rooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
