<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the sensible heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite substantial.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
