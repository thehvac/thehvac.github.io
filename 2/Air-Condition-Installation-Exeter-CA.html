<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets requests for consultation and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, many of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

More recent gas boilers need to achieve 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers need to accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
