<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is frequently essential to figuring out the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such details can often be obtained by asking for copies of air tracking data from the company. If keeping track of information is not readily available, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union agent ought to ask for that the employer have air monitoring tests carried out. Review of this data might identify potentially hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. Nevertheless, when impurity concentrations are really low, monitoring data might not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
