Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>For example, issues develop when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to generate adequate quantities of outside air.

Poorly located outside air consumption vents can also bring in air contaminated with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from washrooms. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading biological pollutants that have actually multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, a/c, or the within surfaces of ventilation duct work.<p>
