<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two heaters were not working, stability Energy was quick to respond. They showed up the next day and replaced two heating systems and make them work.

Honestly, our home heater is complicated, Rob and his team fixed the old duct work, altered all the dampers, make the entire system work completely.<p>
<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment).

In truth, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
