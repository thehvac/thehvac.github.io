<p>I normally don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
