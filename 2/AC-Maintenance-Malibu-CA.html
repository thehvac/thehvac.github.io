<h3>Heating And Cooling Systems in Malibu CA 90265</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System because of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11.

They will be including 3 (3) high velocity supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have a choice for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Provider Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
