<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical material with time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
