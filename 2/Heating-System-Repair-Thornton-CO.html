<p>The split system is the most typical. Many people are utilized to seeing this type in the backyards of homes. With split system units, most of the parts are housed in a metal box beyond the house. However, there are some internal parts as well. Split systems are ideal for cooling several spaces at once, however are not really energy efficient.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
