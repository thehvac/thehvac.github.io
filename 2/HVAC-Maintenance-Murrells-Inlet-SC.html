<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for modern-day a/c unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit increase.

As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
