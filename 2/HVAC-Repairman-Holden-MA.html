Depending upon the type of system set up, it can be loud and trigger issues if you're highly adverse dust. Furthermore, specific fuels and devices might need special permits, and there is restricted versatility in case of changed heating requirements. Throughout usage, there is a time delay while heat is being carried from the heating system to the living space.<p>
<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices typically lasts decades, since it is safeguarded inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most costly to install.

In the past, some improperly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
