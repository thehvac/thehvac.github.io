<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Port Saint Lucie FL?</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating unit. We chose getting something more costly than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our greatest energy costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
