<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate fantastic but Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
