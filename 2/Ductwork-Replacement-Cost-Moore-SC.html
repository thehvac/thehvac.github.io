<p>I am changing our High Velocity System because of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high speed supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines.

For example, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing early wear and tear, causing holes and cracks. , if that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and protects the component.. a very beneficial outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a client thousands.<p>
