The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs.

<p>After the system has actually been looked for leaks, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipe insulation.
