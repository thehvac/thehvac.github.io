Either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. If it leaks, simply adding refrigerant is not a solution. An experienced technician ought to fix any leak, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the right amount of refrigerant. Bear in mind that the efficiency and performance of your air conditioning unit is greatest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the maker's requirements, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leakages can also be damaging to the environment.<p>
