<p>Specialist heating system installations. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heater will eventually stop working. HVAC specialists recommend following this basic guideline when deciding whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a new system, it's finest to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than necessary.<p>
<p>A SEER ranking represents Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio.
