These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be changed or washed as conditions necessitate.

Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
