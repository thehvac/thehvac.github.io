<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
