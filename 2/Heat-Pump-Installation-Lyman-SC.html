<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Lyman SC</h3>

<p>Because it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate since it simply takes more electrical energy to run a larger unit. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the essential wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In reality, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>

I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
