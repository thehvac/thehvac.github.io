<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
