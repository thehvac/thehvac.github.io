<h3>Understanding the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at New York NY</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his evaluation, guaranteeing I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose pipe two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "tough part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and extremely carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

<h3>HVAC Maintenance in New York NY 10025</h3>

<p>G&S did an exceptional task installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best thing about G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Producers service warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they detected the concern and repaired extremely rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>The primary factor house owners do not buy an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 per year, depending upon the quantity of services offered. If the system is new and still under a maker's service warranty, the cost might not be worthwhile. Any major repairs ought to be covered under the producer's service warranty. However, some makers require regular maintenance as a regard to the warranty.<p>
