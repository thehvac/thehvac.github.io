<h3>Knowing the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Dover PA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his evaluation, ensuring I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things initially. Ensure all the registers in your home are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The reduced airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the problem.<p>
