And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts shown and re-installed the detach block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature listed below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
