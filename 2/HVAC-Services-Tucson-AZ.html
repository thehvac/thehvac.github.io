<h3>HVAC Repairman Near Me in Tucson AZ 85705</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System since of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted devices, a Provider, Convenience Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise installing an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including 3 (3) high speed supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an alternative for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Consider a whole house dehumidifier if your single stage air conditioner isn't old enough to validate replacement. By setting up dehumidification equipment inside an existing single stage system, you can enjoy some of the benefits of a variable speed compressor without replacing any equipment. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfy level, improving indoor air quality and enabling greater convenience at greater temperature levels.<p>
