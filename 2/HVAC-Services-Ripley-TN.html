<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace professionals typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too.
