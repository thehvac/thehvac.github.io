<h3>Air Conditioner Repairs Near me in Summerville GA 30747</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline however got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is soaked up from inside and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating sufficient outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
