The choice of indoor units has one restriction: their total power needs to not exceed the capability of the outside unit.

Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the very same time, because the total capacity of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outdoor unit. Put simply, the outside system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that a few of the spaces might not have an extremely comfy temperature level.
