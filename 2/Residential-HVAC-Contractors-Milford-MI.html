<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as important as a regular oil modification in your automobile.

Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. As soon as every 3 months, Energy Star recommends replacing your filter. During high usage months, examine the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
