<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts years, since it is secured inside your home. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical guidelines get rid of the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat gradually, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
<p>There is no simple response, but lots of utilize the guideline that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is probably a better option. If the current system has actually not sustained other significant repairs, remains in otherwise exceptional condition, and issues that caused the breakdown can be determined and fixed, repairing the system can make a lot of sense too.<p>
