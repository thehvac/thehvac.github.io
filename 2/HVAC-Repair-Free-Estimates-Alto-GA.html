<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heating units are still extensively utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues.

If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter likewise causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
