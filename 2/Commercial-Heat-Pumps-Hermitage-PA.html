<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
