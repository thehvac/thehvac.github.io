<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the see. They advised changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty.
