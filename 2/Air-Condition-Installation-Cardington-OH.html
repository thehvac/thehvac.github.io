<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

Ventilation system filters that are not changed on a regular basis may become clogged, minimizing air circulation volume, quality, and distribution.
