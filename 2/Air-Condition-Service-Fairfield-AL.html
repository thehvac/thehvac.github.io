<h3>Tips To Prevent Furnace Repairing Prices in Fairfield AL</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
