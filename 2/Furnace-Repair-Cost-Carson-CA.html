<h3>Energy Efficient Heaters in Carson CA 90745</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best feature of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Makers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they diagnosed the issue and repaired really rapidly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Numerous individuals are ending up being more conscious and concerned about their health and the effect of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt including allergens and contaminants can cover the air conditioning ductwork with time. Occasionally it should be eliminated to enhance and revitalize the quality of indoor air and improve the cooling. Beacon Plumbing, Seattle, WA cleans up the duct physically by removing the particles from the air filter.<p>
<p>A lot of companies utilize third party service warranty companies - not YORK. YORK items are backed by some of the very best limited guarantees in the business, consisting of YORK's factory-backed warranty. Because these service warranties lead the HVAC market in covering parts and key mechanical components, you can feel confident understanding you've selected the very best furnace and a/c for your home or organisation.<p>
