<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
