<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite substantial.<p>
