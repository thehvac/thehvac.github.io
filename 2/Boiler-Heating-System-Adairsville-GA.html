<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Adairsville GA</h3>
<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the job based just on e-mails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the couple of sensible ones got. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand devices. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up team was considerate of my house and set up the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up evaluation outcomes look excellent for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 unit it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
