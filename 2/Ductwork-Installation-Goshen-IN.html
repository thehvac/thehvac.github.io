<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside system as near your home as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
