Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're probably hearing the fan motor attempting to begin without the increase it needs from the capacitor. You can almost always conclude that the capacitor has failed. Often you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pressing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the chances are great that this may work for one cycle, but the capacitor will stop working next time the AC goes on. It's finest to replace the capacitor.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
