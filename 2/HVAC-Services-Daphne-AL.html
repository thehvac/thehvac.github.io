<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe just as essential when it concerns central air costs, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not be able to correctly cool the home on hot days. Thinking about bigger systems cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
<p>At Bob's Heating & Air Conditioning, our company believe in continuous education and training at our extremely own Bob's University. To guarantee our service technicians and installers are at the forefront of HVAC innovation and safety, we need weekly training meetings and bi-weekly safety meetings. Don't have much experience in the HVAC industry? Do not worry! A lot of our employee got all of their education, training, and accreditations through Bob's Heating & Cooling. We have the ability to construct technicians, installers, and customer support reps from the ground up. So, complete an application and start your profession with Bob's Heating & A/c today! You'll be grateful you did.<p>
