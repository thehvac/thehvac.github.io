<p>Next, and possibly simply as important when it concerns central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too big will have an easy time keeping the home cool, however will have a more difficult time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not have the ability to correctly cool the house on hot days. Thinking about bigger units cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and individuals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. It can become airborne when it dries. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
