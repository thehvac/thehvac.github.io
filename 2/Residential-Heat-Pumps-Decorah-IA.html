<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978. The selection of indoor units has one constraint: their overall power needs to not exceed the capability of the outside system.

<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outside unit as near to the house as possible per my request.

He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
