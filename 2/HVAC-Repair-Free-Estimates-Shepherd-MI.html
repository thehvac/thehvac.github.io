<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act similar to standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most affordable. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
