<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are categorized as an Essential Company in Los Angeles.

<p>Benzene is a recognized human carcinogen. The primary indoor sources of this chemical are environmental tobacco smoke, kept fuels and paint products, and auto emissions in connected garages.

<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil modification in your car. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. Energy Star recommends replacing your filter once every three months. During high use months, check the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>

<p>Due to the fact that an a/c unit moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both must be kept clean. This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise needed to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately result in damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
