<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

Humidifier systems on HVAC systems likewise must be effectively maintained to prevent germs and mold contamination.<p>
