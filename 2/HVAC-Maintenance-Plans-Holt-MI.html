The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each room. However, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>

But more complicated problems-- identified by regularly unacceptable air quality tracking results-- will need a various tack.
