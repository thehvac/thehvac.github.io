<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that might impact the health of people who reside in the home. Contaminants could come from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon getting in your home from the ground below. An air pollutant might also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, volatile natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or personal care items. Germs and viruses, pet dander, and pest parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Air contaminants can vary from pollutants brought in from the outdoors by your pets to harmful gas leaks.
