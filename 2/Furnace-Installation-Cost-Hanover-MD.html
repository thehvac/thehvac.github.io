<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He dedicated to the task based just on e-mails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few sensible ones got. Others were almost two times the quantity Protex priced estimate for low end off brand name devices. I got Provider. ProTex correctly advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up group was respectful of my home and set up the devices in the expected amount of time. post install assessment results look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 system it changed (likewise Carrier).<p>
<p>The bottom line is to secure your financial investment by just utilizing the services of a licensed contractor or a qualified agent from a business or retailer to do the installation.

A voided service warranty won't do you any great must the system stop working or breakdown. Do it right from the outset and work with a certified individual with the experience to install the system.<p>
