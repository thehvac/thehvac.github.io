I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
