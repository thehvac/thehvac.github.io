<p>Certain immediate impacts are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often challenging to figure out if the symptoms are an outcome of exposure to indoor air contamination.

If the symptoms fade or disappear when a person is away from the home and return when the person returns, an effort should be made to identify indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some impacts may be worsened by an insufficient supply of outdoor air or from the humidity, heating, or cooling conditions common in the home.<p>
<p>Indoor air quality (also called "indoor ecological quality") describes how inside air can impact a person's ability, convenience, and health to work. It can include temperature level, humidity, absence of outdoors air (bad ventilation), mold from water damage, or direct exposure to other chemicals. Presently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) requirements but it does offer guidelines about the most common IAQ workplace complaints.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
