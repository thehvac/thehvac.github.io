<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you must examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
