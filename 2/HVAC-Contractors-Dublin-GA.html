<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads.

Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outdoor fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
