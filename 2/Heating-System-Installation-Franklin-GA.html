"Humidifier fever" is a common disease caused by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs. Various fungi and bacteria grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these contaminants can be dispersed into the air and inhaled by the structure occupants. Other possible sources of biological contaminants are pets and home plants.<p>

<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation many years earlier and know the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
