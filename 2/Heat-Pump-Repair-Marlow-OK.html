<h3>HVAC Maintenance in Marlow OK 73055</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise changes functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
