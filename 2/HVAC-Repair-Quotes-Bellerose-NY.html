<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes.

Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do not accept them till they have actually been appropriately dried. If products with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
