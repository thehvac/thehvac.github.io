<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
