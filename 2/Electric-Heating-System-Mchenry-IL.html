If the valves on the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional water heater can be turned off entirely.<p>

I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
