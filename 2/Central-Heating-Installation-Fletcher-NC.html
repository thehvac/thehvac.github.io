<p>All homes require effective ventilation. The quality of indoor air inside offices, schools, and other work environments is essential not just for workers' convenience but likewise for their health. Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has been tied to signs like headaches, tiredness, trouble concentrating, and inflammation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. Likewise, some specific diseases have actually been linked to particular air impurities or indoor environments, like asthma with wet indoor environments. In addition, some direct exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not trigger instant signs but can result in cancer after several years.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heating unit, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by dispersing warm water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

<p>1. Central Air Source Heat Pumps Air source heat pumps work best in a mild climate, where the temperature does not get too low or too high. In other words, they are best for our Seattle environment! They are highly effective, beating out most other types of heating systems in performance. The only real exception to this would be a geothermal heatpump system. However, a geothermal installation generally costs tens of thousands more than an air source heat pump, which normally indicates it stops working in terms of return on investment.<p>
