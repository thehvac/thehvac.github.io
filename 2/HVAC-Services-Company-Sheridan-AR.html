<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are categorized as a Necessary Business in Los Angeles. Switched to utilizing Wachoff's about a year earlier and they've been to your house for a system tune-up three times now. They're priced fairly, have dealt with the one repair I needed well, and are always on-time and professional. Have actually been through a few companies throughout the years and Wachoff's is definitely the very best I have actually had the chance to deal with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has been fantastic.<p>

<h3>Ductwork Insulation in Sheridan Arkansas</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>Fantastic Item! Shipment was kind of weird being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. But after review of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The product was very lite weight and takes some time to use. Note: buy suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we solved concerns. I would advise this item to anybody who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
