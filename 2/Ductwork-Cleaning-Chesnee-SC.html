<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>

<p>Central air conditioners, typically described as central air" or split-system cooling", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the ceilings, floorings, or walls covered by grills) carry cooled air from the air conditioning unit to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it flows through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
