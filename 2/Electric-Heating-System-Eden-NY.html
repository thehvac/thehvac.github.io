<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your exposure to this chemical is prudent.

If products with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent sees, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
