<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly the same physical product over time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
