<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either since of visible growth or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
