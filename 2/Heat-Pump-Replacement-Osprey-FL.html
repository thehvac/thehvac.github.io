<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise apartments bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has enjoyed the single-family home installation company completely turn on its head the last few years. Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to up to 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not just with newcomers more familiar with AC living. Longtime Seattle homeowners are finally giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things initially. Ensure all the signs up in your home are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company several years earlier and know the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year.

<p>Only an expert can accurately detect why your furnace isn't beginning. It's time to call a professional if at any point in the process of bleeding the furnace something seems odd or you lose confidence. Likewise, if the procedure doesn't work, something else is wrong and you require a technician to examine the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you find you have to do it often, it's probably time for a professional viewpoint.<p>
