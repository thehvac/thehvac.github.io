<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest won't come on. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that safeguard your a/c system from flooding. Among the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a good chance; you may have a water leakage in the attic. The water activates your emergency security switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is likewise a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate go bad on rare occasions.<p>
