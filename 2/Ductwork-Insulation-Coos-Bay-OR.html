<p>The impacts of lead direct exposure on fetuses and children can be serious. They include hold-ups in physical and psychological development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems.

For systems needing just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by many individuals.<p>
