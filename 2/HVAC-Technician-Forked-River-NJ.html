<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the 2 need to not be puzzled. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's water system, geothermal energy is the procedure by which the heat inside the earth is used for creating power in the form of electrical energy.
