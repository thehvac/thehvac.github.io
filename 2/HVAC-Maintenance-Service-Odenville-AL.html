<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
