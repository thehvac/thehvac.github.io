<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Your Jenkintown PA Home</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, performed a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<p>The split system is the most typical. The majority of people are utilized to seeing this key in the backyards of homes. With split system units, most of the components are housed in a metal box beyond the house. However, there are some internal parts too. Split systems are perfect for cooling multiple spaces simultaneously, but are not very energy efficient. For that reason, one pro is not having loud devices in the home. At the same time, the con would be that those who utilize this might invest more money on cooling costs in the long run since of the lower energy performance.<p>
