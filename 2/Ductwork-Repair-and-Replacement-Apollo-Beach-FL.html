<h3>Air Condition Installation Cost in Apollo Beach FL 33572</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in lots. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your home. For example, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it means the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>EER stands for Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air units is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 Â° F and an indoor temperature of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Numerous AC systems feature a variety of unique features that can further improve efficiency and efficiency. For instance, house owners might want to search for one that comes with a built-in filter light that will inform you when the air filter needs to be altered. Another popular feature to try to find is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on in the evening to decrease energy expenses even more. Naturally, more functions indicate greater central air conditioning costs.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating enough outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
