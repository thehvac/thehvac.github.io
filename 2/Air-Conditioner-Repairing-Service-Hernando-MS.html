<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window.

You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>
<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that may affect the health of individuals who reside in the house. Pollutants might originate from outside the house-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in a connected garage, yard garbage burning, or radon going into your home from the ground below.
