If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
