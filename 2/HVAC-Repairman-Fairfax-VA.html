<h3>Air Conditioner Repair in Fairfax VA 22030</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

<p>Next, and perhaps just as important when it comes to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC system's size.
