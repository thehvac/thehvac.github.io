<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues in homes. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in enough outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the house. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor unit as close to your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
