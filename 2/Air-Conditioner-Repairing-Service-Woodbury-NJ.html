However the chances are excellent that this may work for one cycle, but the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's finest to replace the capacitor.<p>
<p>If the condenser coils are clogged, the compressor can get too hot and shut down. You'll experience intermittent periods of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are clean, clean them once again. Shut off the power. Flip the cooling service and furnace circuit breakers in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Image 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the a/c service still doesn't work effectively after you have actually cleaned up the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC will not work totally unless you do this.<p>
