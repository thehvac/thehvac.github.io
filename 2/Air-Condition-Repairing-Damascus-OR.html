<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just 8 to ten years old, it might suck up to twice the electricity that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's because it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to supply a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment set up simply a few years earlier.<p>
<p>Small HVAC repairs such as merges, breakers, or thermostat replacement expenses in between $150 and $290.
