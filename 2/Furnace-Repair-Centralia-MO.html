Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, really filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
