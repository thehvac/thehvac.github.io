<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives requests for assessment and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>More common in fairly older houses, a boiler-based heating system uses gas, oil or electrical power to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in individual rooms.

Newer gas boilers need to attain 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers should attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
