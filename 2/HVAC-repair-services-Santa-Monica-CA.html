<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most budget-friendly if your home or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
