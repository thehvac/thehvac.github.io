In addition, the large increases in ventilation it takes to significantly minimize exposure to ecological tobacco smoke can also increase energy expenses substantially. As a result, the most efficient way to decrease direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the home is to remove smoking cigarettes there.<p>
