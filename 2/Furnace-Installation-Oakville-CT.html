<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you should inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
