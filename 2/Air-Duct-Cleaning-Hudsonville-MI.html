Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the traditional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>
