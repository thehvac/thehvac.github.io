<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>

Load calculating is referred to as the Handbook J estimation and must be performed by the HVAC contractor before providing an installation or unit cost for a/c. If your contractor states they understand the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square footage alone, move to another contractor. Similar to determining the size of a system needed based on BTUs, determining the right size of system for your house also depends on the system load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>

<p>Outdoor pollutants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a home, outdoor particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and allergens found in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates.
