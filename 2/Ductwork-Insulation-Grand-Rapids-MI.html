<p>I was very pleased in the beginning because things ran efficiently without any noise. Additionally, I saw obvious changes in my electrical energy expenses. After 2 years, things began to change. There have been uncomfortable sounds. I got it inspected and fixed. I am hoping that is the end of the concern. In general, it has actually been a good experience. Dependable on the whole. Neat operation and excellent cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its looks in the start. However then understood Air conditioners are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
