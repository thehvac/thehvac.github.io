<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation expenses. Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfortable.

Incorrectly located outdoor air intake vents can likewise bring in air infected with auto and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading biological contaminants that have actually increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioners, or the inside surface areas of ventilation duct.<p>
