<p>On average, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC unit is wintry, the evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. Likewise, if the a/c smells bad, there might be germs accumulation on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil soaks up the heat far from your home. It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the ac system's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>There is a necessary balance in making your decision though as systems with higher AFUE scores typically come with higher price tags. So, make certain to choose based on how frequently you will utilize your heater, the load that will be placed on it and the frequency with which you plan on having it serviced each year.
