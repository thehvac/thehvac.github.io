<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping in between a outside and indoor unit rather of ducting air directly from the outdoor system.

<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. A ducted heatpump system may be most economical if your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in good condition. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best thing about G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Makers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they identified the problem and repaired very rapidly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ might discover moldy or undesirable smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, speak with your doctor about them. But not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to good structure management.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the two should not be puzzled. Where a geothermal HVAC use the heat inside the earth for space heating, cooling or for heating one's water system, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is utilized for creating power in the form of electrical power. The two operations utilize different processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated up to boiling point to accomplish its aims.<p>
