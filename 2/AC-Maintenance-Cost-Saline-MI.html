<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the standard hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the standard hot water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>
<p>A SEER rating stands for Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER ranking of a system is the cooling output at differing temperatures throughout the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the exact same duration. Essentially, SEER provides more information based upon how the EER performs in different temps. The greater the unit's SEER ranking, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER rating can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all appliances.<p>
