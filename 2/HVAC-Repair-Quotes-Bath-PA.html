<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden floor joist system, underneath the wooded subsurface and last flooring surface. This is normally used in a third-floor or 2nd location and makes the most of the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete pour.

EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, supplies more information on air-cleaning gadgets to decrease indoor air toxins.<p>

Such instant impacts are treatable and generally short-term. Often the treatment is just eliminating the individual's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be recognized. Signs of some illness, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might also show up soon after exposure to some indoor air pollutants.<p>
