Bought a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
