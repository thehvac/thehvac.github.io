On the day of the consultation he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent informing me about our system, and left having solved the problem with a simple repair he did on-site, not changing the whole part. He got along, uncomplicated and a thoroughly satisfying person to have around that whole time.

<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price excellent however Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

We had purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to check the a/c unit prior to you purchase.

R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be bought and utilized by licensed HVAC service technicians. For systems needing only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by many individuals.<p>
