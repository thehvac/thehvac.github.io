Stale air has higher levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. When ventilation is not enough to account for an increase in the number of employees in the location, stale air might likewise be an issue.<p>
<p>Power resources: Validate your access to electrical resources. Many older houses have actually restricted capability to include major devices at the level of a central air conditioning conditioner.

Your AC installer will know what to try to find.<p>
