Generally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, specifically if the objective of owning an organisation was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it required to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't completion objective.
