<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC system than a smaller house, which will impact installation costs. Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfy. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
