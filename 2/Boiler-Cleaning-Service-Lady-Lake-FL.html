<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets ask for consultation and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. However, many of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
