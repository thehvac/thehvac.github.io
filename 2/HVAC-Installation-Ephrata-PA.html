<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me relating to an uncommonly high bill that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he knew that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of concern. Ron had spotted the trouble area in examining the costs. He solved the concern in one day, had actually adjusted the costs to what I thought about fair prior to he recalled, understood what may have caused the problem and had a plan to insure that it would not take place again.

<p>A packaged unit, usually set up on the roofing, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, but it is also a choice for homeowners to consider. Many times, these units consist of not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those aiming to save cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system separately, since the system is combined. However, one con is that these systems are normally only offered for larger homes due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a good way to conserve money on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best option for homeowners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
