<p>If the condenser coils are blocked, the compressor can overheat and shut down. You'll experience intermittent durations of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are clean, clean them again. Shut off the power. Flip the air conditioning service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Picture 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the cooling service still does not work appropriately after you have actually cleaned the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs.
