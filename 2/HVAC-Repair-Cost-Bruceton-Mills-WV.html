<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me relating to an uncommonly high bill that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had actually called the service supervisor and left a message of concern.

<p>Next, and possibly just as essential when it concerns central air conditioning costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not be able to effectively cool the house on hot days.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you should check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
