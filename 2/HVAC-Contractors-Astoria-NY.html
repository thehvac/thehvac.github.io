The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>There are a number of variables that add to indoor air contamination. Such aspects consist of the use of chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furnishings; carbon monoxide gas produced by cigarette smoke and outdoors traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls included in electrical transformers; radiation from constructing insulation; ozone from copiers; and solvents used in cleaners, glues, photo copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>
