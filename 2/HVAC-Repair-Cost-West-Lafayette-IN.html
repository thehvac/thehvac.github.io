<h3>Gas Heating in West Lafayette IN 47906</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes give off contaminants.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have issues, they offer me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
