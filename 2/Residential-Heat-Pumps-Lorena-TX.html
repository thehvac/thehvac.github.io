<p>This is particularly notable, as gas stoves can trigger levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with improperly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>Mobile homes are typically smaller than stick-built properties and utilize significantly less oil and a much smaller furnace to heat. Anticipate the typical mobile home oil furnace to have starting costs of around $1,500. Bear in mind that not as many brand names produce oil heating systems for this use, and you may find more choices with natural gas, lp, or electric heating systems.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the two must not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for space heating, cooling or for heating one's water system, geothermal energy is the procedure by which the heat inside the earth is utilized for generating power in the form of electrical energy. The two operations use various processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be warmed to boiling point to attain its aims.<p>
