The efficiency of these devices is uncertain due to the fact that they only partially remove the radon decay products and do not reduce the quantity of radon getting in the home. EPA prepares to do additional research study on whether air cleaners are, or might become, a trusted means of decreasing the health risk from radon. EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, supplies more details on air-cleaning devices to reduce indoor air pollutants.<p>
