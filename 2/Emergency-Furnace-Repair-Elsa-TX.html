<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer. Connection problems along the line that provides power to your furnace can jeopardize the performance of the unit. Loose, faulty or missing wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and interrupt service. Part of preserving your furnace involves checking the recommended connections along with temperature and pressure gauges. Require time to examine these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are safe and tight.<p>
<p>Houses can have the same indoor air issues as single-family homes since a number of the pollution sources, such as the interior structure products, furnishings, and home products, are comparable. Indoor air problems comparable to those in offices are caused by such sources as contaminated ventilation systems, poorly put outdoor air intakes, or maintenance activities.<p>
