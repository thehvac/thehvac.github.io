<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on.

The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
