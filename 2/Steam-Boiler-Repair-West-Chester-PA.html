<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't provide off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can take place gradually due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should do the trick up until you purchase a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The objective is to provide sufficient modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical component essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
