<p>Central air units are measured in tons. This measurement is based on the system's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service agreement tries to upsell you whenever they come to perform regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for seven years, although it was six months before the existing one expired. She didn't need a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
