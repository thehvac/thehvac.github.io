<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
