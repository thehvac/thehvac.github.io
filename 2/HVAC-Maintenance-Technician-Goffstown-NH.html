<p>It is likewise suggested for residents of Redmond to have access to heater inside their houses. During the winter seasons, furnaces provide adequate heating power to homes in the neighborhood. The average daytime temperature level highs throughout December, January, and February variety from the mid-40s to low-50s.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should temporarily change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
