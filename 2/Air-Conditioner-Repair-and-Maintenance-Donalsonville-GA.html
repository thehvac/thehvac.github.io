<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more problems, given that a few of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. However, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>
