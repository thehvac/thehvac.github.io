Would suggest them anytime.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
