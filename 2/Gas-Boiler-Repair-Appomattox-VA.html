<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
