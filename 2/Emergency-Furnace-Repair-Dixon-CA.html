Improper adjustment, typically suggested by a relentless yellow-tipped flame, causes increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame suggestion is blue.

Never ever use a gas stove to heat your home. When the fireplace is in use, constantly make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
