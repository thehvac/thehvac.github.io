<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of various heater, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

<p>A specific a/c that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioning system in that both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the same air course. A basic ac system transfers heat energy out of the room due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, given that all parts of the dehumidifier are in the same space, no heat is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the room is actually heated, just as by an electric heater that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
