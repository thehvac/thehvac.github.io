<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.  Secondly like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to properly service and the system has actually been running issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
