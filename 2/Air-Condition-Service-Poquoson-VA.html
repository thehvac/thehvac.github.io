This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each room to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioning system into a heatpump While room a/c provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is generally more pricey than central air.<p>
