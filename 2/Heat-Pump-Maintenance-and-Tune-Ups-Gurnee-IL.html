<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current trend in house building and construction is to reduce air leak through cracks and other openings in walls, roofing systems, and floorings.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor impurities and helps tire them from the house.<p>
