<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood just what the issue was and repaired it very quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
