<p>The split system is the most common. The majority of people are utilized to seeing this type in the yards of homes. With split system units, most of the components are housed in a metal box outside of the house. Nevertheless, there are some internal parts as well. Split systems are ideal for cooling multiple rooms simultaneously, but are not really energy effective. For that reason, one pro is not having loud devices in the home.

Indoor houseplants need to not be over-watered because extremely damp soil may promote the growth of bacteria which can affect allergic people.<p>
