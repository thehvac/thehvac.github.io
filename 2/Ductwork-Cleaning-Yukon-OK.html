If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from use.

Furnaces that kick on frequently might be due to a dirty filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air properly.

CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
