<h3>Central Heating Boilers in Great Barrington Massachusetts</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>

<h3>Why You Want Air Conditioning Repair in Great Barrington MA?</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, performed a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, measured particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
