Second of all, if you prepare to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, ensure that an effective moisture barrier is installed prior to setting up the carpet. If it becomes damp, do not completely adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated.<p>
