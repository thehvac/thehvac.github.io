<p>Some health impacts may show up shortly after a single direct exposure or duplicated exposures to a toxin. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such immediate results are generally short-term and treatable. Often the treatment is just removing the individual's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be recognized.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not use auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money can be found in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to provide auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There need to not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
