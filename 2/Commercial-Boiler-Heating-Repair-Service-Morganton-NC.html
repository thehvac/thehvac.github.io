<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant devices producer's to ensure your factory service warranties stay in place. Furthermore, the concrete results of a PM is often tough to quantify, as one action stated the savings in performance or repairs that were avoided. A lot of pieces of a furnace or ac system don't just break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the outcome of repeated use of an element that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing premature degeneration, causing holes and fractures. , if that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and protects the part.. a really advantageous outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
