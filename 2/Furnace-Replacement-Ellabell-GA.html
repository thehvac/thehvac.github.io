In addition, some direct exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not cause immediate symptoms but can result in cancer after several years.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
