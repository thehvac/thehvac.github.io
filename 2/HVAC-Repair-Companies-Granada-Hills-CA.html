<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not use car debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in monthly, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There should not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>The company's head office is based in Cosmo City, Gauteng, and where they disperse their product in all areas in South Africa and neighboring nations, such as Mozambique, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. There are Jet-Air branches in the Western Cape, Kwa-Zulu Natal, Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga, Free State and North West, to offer better customer experiences and accessibility of the products in every region.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not offer them.. Secondly like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to correctly service and the system has been running issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
