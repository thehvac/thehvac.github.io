<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area.

Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in tons. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs.
