Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

To make up for this, the heat pump system should temporarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
