<p>I had an awful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Additionally, the company used 98% of the existing product acquired with your house. This company introduced a service arrangement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and plumbing. During the evaluation on a really cold day they eliminated the furnace claiming health hazard reason and contractor laws for their decision. As a new property owner I have actually discovered how to recognize the sincere HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
