<h3>How to Find Quality Gas Furnace Reviews at Oxford MS</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present trend in home building and construction is to decrease air leak through fractures and other openings in walls, roofs, and floors. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor contaminants and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend used in vehicles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this kind of application, however is still imported and can be purchased and utilized by certified HVAC specialists. For systems needing only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by many people.<p>
