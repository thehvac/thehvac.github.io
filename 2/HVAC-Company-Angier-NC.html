<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as an Essential Business in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are rated 90% performance or much better; it is not unusual for a modern-day furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older models, which might be rated as low as 80% effectiveness, this can mean significant savings in yearly heating costs. Modern two- and three-stage heating systems increase performance even further by running at lower or greater capacity depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your home will not warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A filthy filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
