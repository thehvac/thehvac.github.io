What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
