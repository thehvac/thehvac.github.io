<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. When I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
