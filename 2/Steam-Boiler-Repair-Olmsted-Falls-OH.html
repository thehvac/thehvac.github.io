A ductless system has an integrated effectiveness benefit because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leaks in your ducts.

<p>If you think a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>The compressor can shut and get too hot down if the condenser coils are blocked. You'll experience periodic durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them again. Shut off the power. Flip the cooling service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the detach block (Photo 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the a/c service still does not work effectively after you have actually cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs.
