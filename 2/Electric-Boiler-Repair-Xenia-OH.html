<p>Proper ventilation assists enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the same toxins. To put it simply, in some cases the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>

<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance at Xenia OH</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the math recently, however I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine evaluations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their work with a company that was working on the patio area where the system sits. I feel like they give me favoritism, and want to pay a bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
