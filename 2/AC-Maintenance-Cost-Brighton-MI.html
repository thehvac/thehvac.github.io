They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty.
