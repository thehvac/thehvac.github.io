This indicates that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>

<p>5. Smell good naturally. You might associate that lemony or piney scent with a clean kitchen or clean artificial scents in laundry items and air fresheners emit lots of different chemicals into the air.

<p>I called Snowflake Air because my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around fixing the issue, all the while explaining everything to me.

I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
