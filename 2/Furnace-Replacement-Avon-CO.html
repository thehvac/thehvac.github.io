<h3>A Synopsis of Central Heating Systems in Avon CO</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing pattern in house building and construction is to minimize air leakage through cracks and other openings in walls, floors, and roofings. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor pollutants and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
