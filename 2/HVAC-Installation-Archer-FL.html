<h3>Truth All Homeowners Must Know About HVAC Installation in Archer FL</h3>
<p>In the last several years, a growing body of clinical proof has shown that the air within homes and other buildings can be more seriously polluted than the outside air in even the biggest and most industrialized cities. Other research suggests that people spend roughly 90 percent of their time indoors. Hence, for many individuals, the threats to health might be greater due to direct exposure to air pollution inside than outdoors.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
