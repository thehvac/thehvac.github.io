<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical home. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
