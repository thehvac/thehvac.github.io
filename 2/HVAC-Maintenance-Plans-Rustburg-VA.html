<p>Correct ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same pollutants.

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. With time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you want to get those capacitors altered to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>Air toxins can vary from contaminants brought in from the outdoors by your animals to harmful gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a common air contaminant arising from gas that leaves into your house without being burnt. Older homes might include asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when launched into the air. In kitchens and bathrooms, mold and mildew can end up being an annoyance where wetness levels are usually higher than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment manufacturer's to guarantee your factory service warranties remain in place. Additionally, the tangible results of a PM is typically difficult to quantify, as one response stated the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. The majority of pieces of a furnace or a/c don't just break at the snap of a finger, however rather is the outcome of recurring use of a component that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering early wear and tear, resulting in holes and fractures. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the component.  a very helpful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
