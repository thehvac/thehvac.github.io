<h3>Why Choose a Natural Gas Furnace at Chesterfield VA?</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they required to get rid of the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heater. We picked getting something more costly than a conventional water heater as gas is among our greatest utility costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
