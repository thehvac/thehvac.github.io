<h3>Ductwork Insulation in La Jolla California</h3>

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
