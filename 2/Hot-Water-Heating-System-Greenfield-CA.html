<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost excellent however Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
