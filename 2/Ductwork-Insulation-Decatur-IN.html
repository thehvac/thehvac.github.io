<p>Geographically, some locations pay consistently greater wages for air conditioning tradespersons. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable environment, or merely a high level of competitors for skilled trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the country's highest typical salaries for HVAC service technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 annually. The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 each year. Massachusetts and Connecticut rounded out the 5 highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 per year.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to offer your house that ideal temperature level all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing a few of those typical air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can cause costly repairs down the road. So, be sure to alter your AC filters frequently, or get an air conditioning service plan which generally includes a filter modification - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transmitted by people and animals; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Contaminated central air handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
