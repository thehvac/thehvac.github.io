When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical standards get rid of the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
