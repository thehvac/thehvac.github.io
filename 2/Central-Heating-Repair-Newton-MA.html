<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps in Newton MA</h3>
<p>In the last several years, a growing body of scientific proof has actually indicated that the air within homes and other buildings can be more seriously polluted than the outside air in even the biggest and most industrialized cities. Other research shows that individuals spend around 90 percent of their time inside your home. Hence, for many people, the dangers to health might be higher due to exposure to air pollution inside your home than outdoors.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend utilized in vehicles in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and utilized by licensed HVAC technicians. For systems needing only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by lots of people.<p>
