<h3>Ductwork Repair and Replacement in Niantic Connecticut</h3>
<p>Lots of people undervalue the degree of the indoor air contamination problem. Air pollution is usually visualized as the black smoke given off from factories.

To compound the issue, it is estimated that the typical American invests 70 percent to 90 percent of his or her time inside your home, and majority that time is spent in the home.<p>
<p>In a packaged central air conditioner, the evaporator, compressor, and condenser are all located in one cabinet, which usually is placed on a roof or on a concrete slab beside the house's structure.

<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Function in Niantic CT?</h3>
<p>A hydronic radiant flooring heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipes installed under the flooring or right within the flooring surface itself.

<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
