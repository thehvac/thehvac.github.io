<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping between a outside and indoor system rather of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature, and after that switch it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioning unit's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
