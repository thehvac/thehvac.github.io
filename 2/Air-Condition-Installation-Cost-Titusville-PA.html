<p>A number of initiatives imagine to reduce indoor air contamination by limiting VOC emissions from products. There are policies in France and in Germany, and numerous voluntary ecolabels and ranking systems including low VOC emissions criteria such as EMICODE, 19 M1, 20 Blue Angel 21 and Indoor Air Comfort 22 in Europe, along with California Requirement CDPH Area 01350 23 and numerous others in the U.S.A..

<p>Air conditioning unit can produce a lot of water since they eliminate moisture from the air. To eliminate this, they have a generally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In reality, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the area. To deal with condensate issues, please see Air Conditioner Leaks Water, below.<p>
