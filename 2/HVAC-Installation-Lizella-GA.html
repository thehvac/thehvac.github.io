<p>As many of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant devices manufacturer's to ensure your factory guarantees stay in place. Additionally, the tangible outcomes of a PM is typically hard to measure, as one action mentioned the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. Many pieces of a furnace or ac system do not simply break at the breeze of a finger, however rather is the outcome of repetitive usage of an element that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing early degeneration, leading to cracks and holes. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the component.  a very useful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
