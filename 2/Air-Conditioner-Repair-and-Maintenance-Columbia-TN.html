<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Columbia TN</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even small window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or cleaned as conditions require. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will require to have the filters changed regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Furthermore, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the space temperature level, and then change it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning unit's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You ought to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
