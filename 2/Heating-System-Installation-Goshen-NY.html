<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
