<p>Your questions or concerns about indoor air problems can regularly be responded to by the federal government companies in your state or local government. Responsibilities for indoor air quality issues are typically divided amongst several companies. Calling or writing the agencies responsible for health or air quality control is the best way to begin getting details from your state or city government.

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide ought to be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements used for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may likewise be necessary.<p>
<p>Normally the most reliable method to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of private sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions.
