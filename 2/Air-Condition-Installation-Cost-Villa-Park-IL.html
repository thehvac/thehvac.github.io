<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
