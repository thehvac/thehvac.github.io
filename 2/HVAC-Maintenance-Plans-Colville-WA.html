<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
