<h3>Air Conditioning And Refrigeration in Gardendale Alabama</h3>
<p>Using air filters can trap some of the air pollutants. The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable resource section recommends that "Air Filtering should have a Minimum Performance Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as figured out by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are utilized to reduce the quantity of dust that reaches the wet coils. Dust can serve as food to grow molds on the damp coils and ducts and can lower the performance of the coils.<p>
<p>2. Keep a healthy level of humidity. Dust mites and mold love wetness. Keeping humidity around 30% -50% helps keep them and other allergens under control. A dehumidifier (and air conditioning unit during summertime) helps reduce wetness in indoor air and efficiently controls allergens, Lang says. An ac system also lowers indoor pollen count - another plus for allergy -sufferers.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to alter your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as vital as a routine oil modification in your cars and truck. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter better traps pollutants and debris in the air. Energy Star suggests replacing your filter when every 3 months. Throughout high usage months, inspect the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
