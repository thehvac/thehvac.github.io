It has also been revealed to trigger cancer in animals and may cause cancer in humans.<p>
<p>Inspect these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in your house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). The decreased air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
