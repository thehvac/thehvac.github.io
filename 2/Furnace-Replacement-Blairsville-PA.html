On Long Island where we lie, as anywhere else, there are credible contractors and those who are less credible.

<p>Central air conditioners are more efficient than space air conditioning system. In addition, they run out the way, quiet, and convenient to run. To conserve energy and cash, you should shop an energy-efficient a/c and decrease your central air conditioning conditioner's energy usage. In a typical air-conditioned house, air conditioning takes in more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electrical energy each year, triggering power plants to emit about 3,500 pounds of carbon dioxide and 31 pounds of sulfur dioxide.<p>

<p>Direct Exposure Control: Changing the time and area of contaminant direct exposure. An example of time control is scheduling floor waxing and stripping (with the ventilation system working) on a Friday. This permits items to off-gas over the weekend while most of the personnel are at home over the weekend. Area control includes moving the contaminant source far from occupants or perhaps relocating prone occupants.<p>

<p>You might upgrade to the greatest efficiency gear available and still not feel comfortably cool on hot days. That's because the mechanicals are only part of the central air conditioning system. The typical house's ductwork leakages 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your home, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Before choosing whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower systems, your technician must run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring just how much air leaves the system.<p>
