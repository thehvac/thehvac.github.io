<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
