<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heaters are still widely used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>When asbestos-containing material is harmed or breaks down, tiny fibers are distributed into the air. Inhalation of asbestos fibers over long exposure times is related to increased incidence of lung cancer, in particular the particular type mesothelioma The risk of lung cancer from inhaling asbestos fibers is substantially greater to smokers, however there is no confirmed connection to damage caused by asbestosis The symptoms of the illness do not usually appear till about 20 to 30 years after the very first exposure to asbestos.<p>

<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control may contravene efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperature levels (style levels), rather of the higher temperature levels sometimes used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to supply thermal convenience inside.

<p>In more complex plans, warm air is enabled to increase and flow out high structure openings to the outdoors (stack result ), triggering cool outside air to be drawn into low structure openings. Natural ventilation plans can use very little energy, however care should be taken to ensure comfort. In warm or damp environments, keeping thermal comfort solely through natural ventilation might not be possible. Air conditioning systems are used, either as backups or supplements. Air-side economizers also utilize outdoors air to condition spaces, but do so utilizing fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and disperse cool outside air when suitable.<p>
