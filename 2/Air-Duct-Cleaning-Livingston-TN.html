The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 per year. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 each year.

<p>Allergens are materials that cause an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens discovered in indoor air are mostly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can become airborne, and therefore, are easily inhaled. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For example, if you consider a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of feline irritant might bring on an asthma attack in people with cat allergies, but not in those individuals who do not have cat allergies.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues.
