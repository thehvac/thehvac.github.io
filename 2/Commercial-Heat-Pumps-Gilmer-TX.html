<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
