<p>The purpose of many building ventilation systems is to generate adequate fresh air for resident convenience while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and building safety at sensible energy expenses. Load calculating is described as the Manual J estimation and must be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or unit cost for air conditioning. Move to another contractor if your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square video alone. As with measuring the size of a system required based on BTUs, identifying the correct size of unit for your house also depends on the unit load-- how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
