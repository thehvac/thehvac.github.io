<p>Fact: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely uncommon now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really remove countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>Because HVAC specialists need to be physically present to do their work, they have not traditionally provided remote or virtual services. However, with the value of social distancing due to COVID-19, the need for remote abilities is greater than ever. If you come across a profile that mentions the HVAC technician or AC expert is offering remote services, message the pro to discover what those services include.<p>
