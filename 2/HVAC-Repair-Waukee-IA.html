<h3>HVAC Installation in Waukee Iowa</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech showed up right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the visit. They advised changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap however a quick internet search validated WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part.

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on different house effectiveness upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.)

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend used in autos in the U.S. up until 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12.

For systems requiring just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by lots of individuals.<p>
