<h3>Signs You Might Need an AC Repair Service in Spring TX</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. In some cases, measured particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Examine these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
