The firm started in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature clients for years, till the mandate for high-efficiency units required Goettl to end production.

Goodrich's dad was a Goettl dealer in Las Vegas, so when the opportunity came to purchase what was left of the firm in 2013, he took it.<p>
