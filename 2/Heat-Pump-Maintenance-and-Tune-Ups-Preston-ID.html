HVAC specialists recommend following this fundamental rule when deciding whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the price of a brand-new system, it's best to buy new.

When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your house.
