<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run. Due to the fact that it just takes more electricity to run a bigger unit, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate. And an oversize system does not lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down prior to it has an opportunity to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed moisture. The outcome is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In reality, the room can feel damp and clammy.<p>
