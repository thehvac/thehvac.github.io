<p>I usually don't leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about choices. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
