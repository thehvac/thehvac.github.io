<p>Truth: Geothermal systems really consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that exact same aquifer.

<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance at Newtonville MA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to remove the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heater.

<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
