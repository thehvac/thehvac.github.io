<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their total power needs to not go beyond the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is really common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units greater than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. However, it is incorrect to anticipate much better efficiency when all indoor units are turned on at the same time, because the overall capability of the whole system is restricted by the capability of the outdoor unit. Simply put, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that a few of the rooms may not have a very comfortable temperature level.
