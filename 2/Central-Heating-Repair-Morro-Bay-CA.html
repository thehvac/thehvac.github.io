<p>Fact: Federal and local rewards usually amount to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can often make the preliminary price of a system competitive with conventional devices. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capability, during new construction (homes generally use between one and five loads). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load. However, new installation practices are lowering costs, to the point where the cost is getting closer to conventional systems under the best conditions.<p>
