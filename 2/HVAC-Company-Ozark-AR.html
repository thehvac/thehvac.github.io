<h3>Choosing the Right HVAC System For The Job in Ozark AR</h3>
<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He dedicated to the task based only on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few affordable ones received. Others were nearly twice the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install team was respectful of my house and set up the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post install inspection results look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 system it replaced (likewise Provider).<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
