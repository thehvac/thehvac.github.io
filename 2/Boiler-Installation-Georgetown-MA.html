<p>If the condenser coils are blocked, the compressor can shut and overheat down. You'll experience periodic durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are clean, tidy them once again. Turn off the power.

Then pull the disconnect block (Photo 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Photo 2).

<h3>The Way to Choose a Specialist HVAC Technician in Georgetown MA</h3>
<p>Sean was very handy. He is a really pleasant person to deal with. No pressure used to buy extra things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. The only reason he might not set up the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
