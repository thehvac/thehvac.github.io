<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.

<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product over time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
