<p>An indoor air toxin is a substance in the air that may impact the health of people who live in the home. Toxins could originate from outside the home-- such as an idling vehicle engine in an attached garage, yard garbage burning, or radon going into your home from the ground below. An air contaminant might also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, unpredictable organic substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on moist or wet carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or personal care products. Infections and bacteria, animal dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
