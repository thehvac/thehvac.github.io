<p>Air flow patterns in structure are determined by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts. Atmospheric pressure differences created by these forces move air-borne contaminants from locations of greater pressure to locations of lower pressure through any readily available opening in structure walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is little, air will move up until the inside pressure amounts to the outside.<p>
<p>In addition, property owners have a range of alternatives to select from in powering a floor heating unit. Glowing systems work with electrical, natural gas, solar and even geothermal energy sources. As lots of homeowners are all too aware, legacy furnace systems are typically limited to running on a single energy source, such as heating oil.
