<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Work in Lake Placid FL?</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing trend in home building and construction is to reduce air leakage through cracks and other openings in floorings, walls, and roofing systems. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor contaminants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
