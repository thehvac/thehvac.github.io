That's since it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to offer a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment installed simply a few years ago.<p>
<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not use automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in each month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to use auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
