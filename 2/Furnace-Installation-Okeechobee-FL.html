The heat from the warm water transfers to the floor mass and after that radiates through thermal transfer to other articles with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and people. It does not rely on heating or moving air to move warmth.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
