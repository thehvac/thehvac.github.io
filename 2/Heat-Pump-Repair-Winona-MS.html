<p>Using a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors significantly lowers exposure to pollutants during cooking. Incorrect adjustment, often indicated by a relentless yellow-tipped flame, causes increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. Think about buying one with pilotless ignition due to the fact that it does not have a pilot light that burns continuously if you buy a new gas range or variety. Never ever use a gas range to heat your home. When the fireplace is in usage, constantly make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
