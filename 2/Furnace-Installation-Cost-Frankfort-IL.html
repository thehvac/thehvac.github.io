<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace in Frankfort IL?</h3>
<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of exchanging or replacing air in any area to supply high indoor air quality which involves temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne germs, co2, and other gases. Ventilation removes undesirable smells and excessive wetness, introduces outside air, keeps interior building air circulating, and prevents stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
