<p>A/c can also be offered by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
