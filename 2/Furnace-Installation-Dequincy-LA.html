<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the floor as a distribution system. Metal pipes are rarely used due to long-term destructive issues.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation.

There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A common component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
