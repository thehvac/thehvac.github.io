When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
