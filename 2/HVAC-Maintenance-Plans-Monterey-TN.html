<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.
