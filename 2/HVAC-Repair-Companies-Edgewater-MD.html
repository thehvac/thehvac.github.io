<p>How climate modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern air conditioning unit) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system boost. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
