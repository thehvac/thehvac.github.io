<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me relating to an abnormally high expense that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he knew that I had actually called the service supervisor and left a message of issue.

<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off contaminants.)

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you need to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
