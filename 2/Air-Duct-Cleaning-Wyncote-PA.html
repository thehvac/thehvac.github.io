<p>These principles-- and willingness to suffer through the heat-- may currently be altering. Though only 33 percent of Seattle housing systems had air conditioning in 2015, more than 46,000 brand-new housing units have actually been integrated in the four years considering that or are currently under construction.

Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment set up just a couple of years ago.<p>
