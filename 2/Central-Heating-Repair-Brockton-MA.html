<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
