<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product with time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
