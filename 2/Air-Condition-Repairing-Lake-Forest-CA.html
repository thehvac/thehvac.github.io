The company began in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature customers for decades, up until the mandate for high-efficiency units required Goettl to end production. The contracting side of the business continued under several owners. Goodrich's daddy was a Goettl dealer in Las Vegas, so when the opportunity came to purchase what was left of the company in 2013, he took it.<p>

<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This lessens the interior system footprint and allows each space to be changed independently. PTAC systems might be adapted to provide heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heatpump While space a/c provides optimum versatility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is typically more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
