He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation many years earlier and know the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
