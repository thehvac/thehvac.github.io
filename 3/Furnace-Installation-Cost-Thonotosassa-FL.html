<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present pattern in house building and construction is to minimize air leakage through fractures and other openings in floorings, walls, and roofing systems. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor contaminants and helps tire them from the home.<p>

<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
