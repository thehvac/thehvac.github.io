<h3>HVAC Installation in Moultrie GA 31768</h3>
<p>Central air units are determined in loads. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it implies the quantity of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
