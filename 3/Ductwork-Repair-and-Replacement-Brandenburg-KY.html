<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
