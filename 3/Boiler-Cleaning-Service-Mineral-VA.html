<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you may require a referral later on). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
