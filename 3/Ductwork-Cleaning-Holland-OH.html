There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is likewise proof from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at particular risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
