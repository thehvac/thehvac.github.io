<p>As noted, incorrect temperature level and humidity levels, and too much or too little air circulation may likewise contribute to employee health problems. Temperature level levels ought to range from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30% and 60%.

<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that just an experienced HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can result in costly compressor failure, but a property owner does not have the tools or abilities required to check refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and correct air flow are necessary to a well-functioning system, but house owners lack the necessary devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still needed to have a specialist technician examine the system regularly.<p>

Due to the fact that numerous health problems can trigger these symptoms, diagnosing sick building syndrome is difficult. Very high levels of some contaminants, such as carbon monoxide gas, can cause more major illness, including death.<p>
