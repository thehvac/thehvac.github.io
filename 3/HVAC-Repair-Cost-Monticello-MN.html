<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act just like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. A ducted heatpump system may be most budget-friendly if your home or building has an existing duct system that is in good condition. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the need to set up an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

In many cases, source control is also a more affordable approach to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are listed later in this area.<p>
