<p>Central air conditioners, frequently described as central air" or split-system a/c", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the walls, ceilings, or floorings covered by grills) carry cooled air from the ac system to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it flows through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Learn how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
