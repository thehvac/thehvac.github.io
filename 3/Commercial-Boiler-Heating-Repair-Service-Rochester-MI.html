<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heating unit, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the room.<p>
