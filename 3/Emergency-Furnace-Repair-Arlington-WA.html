<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
