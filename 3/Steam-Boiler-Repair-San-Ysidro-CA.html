<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures through mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
