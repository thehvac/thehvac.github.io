<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

At lower levels of exposure, CO triggers mild impacts that are often mistaken for the flu. These signs include headaches, lightheadedness, queasiness, fatigue and disorientation. The effects of CO direct exposure can vary significantly from individual to individual depending upon age, total health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
