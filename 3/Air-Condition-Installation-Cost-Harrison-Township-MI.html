<p>Radiant heating covers a series of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
