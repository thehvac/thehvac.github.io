The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
