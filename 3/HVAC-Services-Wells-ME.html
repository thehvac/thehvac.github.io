Outbreaks in medical centers and assisted living home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outside fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water materials is extremely under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
