<h3>Why Choose a Natural Gas Furnace in Spring Valley NY?</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heater. We decided on getting something more costly than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our biggest utility costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
