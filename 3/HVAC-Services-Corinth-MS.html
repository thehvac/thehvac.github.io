Nevertheless, considering that all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the very same room, no heat is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is really warmed, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>
