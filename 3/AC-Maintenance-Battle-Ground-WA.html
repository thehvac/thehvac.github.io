<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was really handy in collecting details on the phone and offering clear directions about how to briefly deal with the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and provided clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off contaminants.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
