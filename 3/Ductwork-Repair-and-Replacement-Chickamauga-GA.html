<p>Specialist heating system installations. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately fail. HVAC professionals suggest following this basic rule when deciding whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the price of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than necessary.<p>
<p>More typical in fairly older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes gas, electrical power or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in private rooms.

Newer gas boilers must accomplish 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers need to attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
