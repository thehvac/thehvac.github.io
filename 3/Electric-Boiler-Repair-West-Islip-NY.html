<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. Due to the fact that approximately 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless system has a built-in performance advantage. Ductless heatpump are fantastic for additions because they do not need any new ductwork to be set up. Due to the fact that a system is set up in each room or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy.

<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things initially. Ensure all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The lowered air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the issue.<p>

<p>Current Review: They were terrific! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially requested.
