<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature of the floor. All wiring for your radiant heating system either goes to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the location is dry and unobstructed.<p>
<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms heated up by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot beside the radiators. This normally leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your home escape out of the window. Radiant heat supplies heat from the flooring up throughout the room without any cold areas or stuffiness in the area being heated up.<p>
