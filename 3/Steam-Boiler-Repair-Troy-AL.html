<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
