<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your home at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will need a much larger AC system than a smaller house, which will impact installation costs. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can impact this could be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
