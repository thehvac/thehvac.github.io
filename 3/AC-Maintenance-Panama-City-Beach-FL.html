<p>Since a task such as this is going to need a rather comprehensive quantity of work it is advised that a homeowner request several estimates from a variety of contractors. The best times of the year to do such a task are in the months in which homes are not using their heater. This will typically allow the work to be completed rapidly and the house owner to get the very best pricing readily available.

Prior to we design and install any systems, we arrange a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will recommend improvements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these improvements.
