There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema.

<p>The split system is the most typical. Most people are used to seeing this enter the yards of homes. With split system units, most of the parts are housed in a metal box beyond the house. Nevertheless, there are some internal components as well. Split systems are ideal for cooling numerous rooms at once, but are not very energy efficient. Therefore, one pro is not having loud devices in the house. At the very same time, the con would be that those who utilize this might spend more cash on cooling expenses in the long run because of the lower energy efficiency.<p>
<p>A packaged unit, normally installed on the roofing system, is most commonly used on commercial structures, but it is also a choice for house owners to consider.
