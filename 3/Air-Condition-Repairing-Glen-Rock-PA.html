<p>Iâ $ m truly particular with my stuff. I like my devices and devices original, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with inexpensive knock-offs.

<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
