<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a big central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heatpump work on electrical power and work like air conditioning unit in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This allows them to produce two to three times as much heat as a standard electric heating unit (like a space heating unit) with the very same quantity of electrical power. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He knew simply what the issue was and repaired it extremely rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
