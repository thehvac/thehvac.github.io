<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a recommendation in the future). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually switched all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
