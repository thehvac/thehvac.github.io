<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils.
