<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
