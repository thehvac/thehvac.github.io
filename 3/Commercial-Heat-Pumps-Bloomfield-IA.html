<p>A/c can likewise be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>
