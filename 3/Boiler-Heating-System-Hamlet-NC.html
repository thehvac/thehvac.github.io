<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c back into its original box, using the dense-foam packing material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and safeguard it from moisture.<p>
<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and kids can be extreme. They include hold-ups in mental and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral issues.
