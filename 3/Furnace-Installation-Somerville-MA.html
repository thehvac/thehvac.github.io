They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they needed to purchase it. My better half stated that she had seen a terrific review for James, so I called. He was available in a few hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the circumstance to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most good people I have met in a long time.
