<p>All Points Heating provides home air conditioning, a/c unit installation, a/c maintenance that deliver reliable, tested efficiency at high performance. Combustion products from automobile exhaust, furnaces, hot water heater, area heaters, aromatic candles, oil lamps, wood stoves, fireplaces, and gas ranges that are not properly vented can generate carbon monoxide gas, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates. These combustion items might result in eye, nose, and throat irritation; fatigue; lightheadedness; and queasiness.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside unit as close to the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
