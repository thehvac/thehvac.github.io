<p>The quality of the air inside our houses, offices and schools matters, particularly given that we invest the majority of our lives inside. Air conditioning unit help to dehumidify the inbound air, however in incredibly damp climates or in cases where the a/c is oversized, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the a/c unit will need more energy to cool your house. A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're dealing with a Web of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality tracking equipment will send out the sensing unit information to the cloud, where you can access it via software. You get instant, real-time access to the tracking results via a control panel, which turns the information into visual charts that are easy to decipher.<p>
