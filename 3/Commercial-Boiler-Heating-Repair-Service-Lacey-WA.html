They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they had to purchase it. My other half said that she had actually seen a fantastic evaluation for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most good people I have actually met in a long period of time.
