<h3>Energy Efficient Heaters in Carthage NY 13619</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
