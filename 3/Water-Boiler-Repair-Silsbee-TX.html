<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
