<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC system than a smaller house, which will affect installation costs. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfy. Other elements that can affect this could be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school structures.<p>
