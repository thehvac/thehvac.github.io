<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
