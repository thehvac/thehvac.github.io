<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in Hot Springs Village AR</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really delighted that someone as experienced as Adam had the ability to fix the air and return conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to check the a/c prior to you buy. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had ways to check AC units even in winter season. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>
<p>First, understand that a bulk of your central air conditioning and system cost will originate from the unit itself. AC system costs start at $2,000 and can really exceed $10,000 for bigger homes. As you saw recently, you require an appropriately-sized unit for your home. Otherwise, the AC will break down earlier than anticipated or your month-to-month energy expenses will increase. Therefore, you don't have overall control as to your AC system product costs.<p>
