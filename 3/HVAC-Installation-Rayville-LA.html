<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals.

Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have actually been effectively dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. If products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>
