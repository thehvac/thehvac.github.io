<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
