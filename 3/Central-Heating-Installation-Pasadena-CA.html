<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his staff members, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, specifically if the goal of owning a company was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it took to build business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't completion goal.
