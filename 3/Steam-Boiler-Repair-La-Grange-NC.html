Others were almost two times the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The set up team was considerate of my house and installed the equipment in the expected quantity of time. post install inspection results look great for braising and plumbing quality.
