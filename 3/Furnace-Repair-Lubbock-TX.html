<h3>Central Heating Systems in Lubbock Texas</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the check out. They suggested changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost however a fast web search validated WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was very delighted they stood by their work and repaired the problem. Will certainly be using them once again.<p>
