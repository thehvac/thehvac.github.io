<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps can be quickly incorporated with existing systems such as traditional forced air or radiant floor heating or can be set up in a new building.

Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heat pump installation and can help you appropriately size a system.<p>
