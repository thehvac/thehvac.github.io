This is normally used in a third-floor or second location and makes the most of the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional density of an in-screed concrete pour.

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a reference later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters ought to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
