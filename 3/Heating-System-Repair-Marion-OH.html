<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
