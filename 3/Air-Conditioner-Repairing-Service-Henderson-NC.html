<p>Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and place of toxin exposure. An example of time control is setting up flooring waxing and stripping (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday. This permits products to off-gas over the weekend while the majority of the personnel are at house over the weekend. Location control involves moving the contaminant source away from occupants or perhaps moving susceptible residents.<p>
<p>Air flow patterns in structure are figured out by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts. Air pressure distinctions developed by these forces move airborne toxins from areas of higher pressure to locations of lower pressure through any available opening in building walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is little, air will move until the within pressure amounts to the outside.<p>
<p>A/c can develop a great deal of water due to the fact that they remove wetness from the air. To get rid of this, they have a normally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. With time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location. To deal with condensate problems, please see Air conditioning unit Leaks Water, below.<p>
