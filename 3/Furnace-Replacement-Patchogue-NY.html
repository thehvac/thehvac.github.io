<h3>Air Conditioner Reviews in Patchogue NY 11772</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss choices. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
