<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be shut off completely.<p>
<p>Place the solar storage tank near the standard hot water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the tank, ensure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are available. If the heat exchanger is external to the tank, it is likely that it is supported by the plumbing. If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed, set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut.<p>

But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
