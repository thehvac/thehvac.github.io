<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product with time.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
