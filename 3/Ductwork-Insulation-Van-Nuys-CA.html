<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance in Van Nuys CA</h3>
<p>All contemporary cooling systems, even small window package units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions require. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, very unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
