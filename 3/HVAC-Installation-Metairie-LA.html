<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide must be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might also be required.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your home that best temperature level throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out a few of those common air contaminants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task.

So, make certain to alter your AC filters frequently, or get an a/c service plan which normally consists of a filter modification - particularly if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
