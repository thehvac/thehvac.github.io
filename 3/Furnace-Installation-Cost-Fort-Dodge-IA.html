A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on.

<p>In general, ductless AC systems are more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly than standard HVACs. This is due to the fact that you can shut off individual spaces when you're not occupying them. On top of that, ductless ACs can raise and decrease their temperature easily, conserving you energy and cash that routine HVAC compressors will waste by constantly starting up and turning themselves off.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. Gradually, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you want to get those capacitors altered to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
