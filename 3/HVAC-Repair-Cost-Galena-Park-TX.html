Every maintenance job may need completely different actions and processes than the previous, depending on the age and condition of the system being examined.

<p>A matched system is the mix of items that comprise your HVAC system. Depending on your area, a matched system can be made up of the following: an air conditioner and furnace, a heat pump and furnace, a heatpump and air handler, an a/c and air handler, or an all-in-one packaged" system. By combining parts that are made to work perfectly together, you can create a more efficient ideal system.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
