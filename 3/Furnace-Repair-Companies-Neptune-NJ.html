The temperature level of the inbound air is lowered, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be rather substantial.<p>
