<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
