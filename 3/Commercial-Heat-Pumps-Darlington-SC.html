Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has actually viewed the single-family house installation service completely flip on its head the last few years. Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to as much as 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not just with newbies more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle house owners are lastly giving in, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Examine these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in your home are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the issue.<p>
