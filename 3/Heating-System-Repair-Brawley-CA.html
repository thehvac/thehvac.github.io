<p>The compressor can overheat and shut down if the condenser coils are blocked. You'll experience intermittent periods of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are clean, tidy them once again. Turn off the power. Flip the cooling service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the disconnect block (Image 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the air conditioning service still does not work appropriately after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC won't work totally unless you do this.<p>

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter.

If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
