It's a little-known reality that the quality and cleanliness of your air ductwork is simply as essential as your HVAC system. Dust and grime will typically develop in ductwork, limiting air flow.

In an average air-conditioned house, a/c takes in more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electrical power annually, causing power plants to release about 3,500 pounds of carbon dioxide and 31 pounds of sulfur dioxide.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
