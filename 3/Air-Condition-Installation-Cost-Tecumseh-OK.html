If you acquire a new gas stove or variety, consider purchasing one with pilotless ignition since it does not have a pilot burner that burns continuously. Never ever utilize a gas stove to heat your house. When the fireplace is in use, constantly make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
