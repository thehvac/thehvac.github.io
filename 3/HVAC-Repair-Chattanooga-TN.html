The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor contaminants and assists exhaust them from the house.<p>
<p>Installation involves digging long trenches or deep holes to install the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end.

The absence of moving parts implies you're less likely to invest huge on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be anticipated to last for 50 years. They're considerably more effective then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>
