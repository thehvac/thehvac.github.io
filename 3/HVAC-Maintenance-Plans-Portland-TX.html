As a first step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor guidelines based on the most current science for NO2.

If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a great concept of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil. The first thing you require to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you're in luck, that's more than likely your issue. If you discovered that your conditioning filter needs replacing, then the next step is to defrost your cooling equipment. The simplest method to defrost your HVAC equipment is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
