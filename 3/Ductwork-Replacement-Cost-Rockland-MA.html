To avoid straining an air conditioning system's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on.

<p>Air toxins can vary from pollutants brought in from the outdoors by your family pets to harmful gas leakages. Carbon monoxide gas is a common air contaminant arising from gas that gets away into your home without being burnt. Older homes might contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In cooking areas and restrooms, mold and mildew can become an annoyance where moisture levels are usually greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must momentarily change back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
