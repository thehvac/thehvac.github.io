<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct.

When the a/c works but your home does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
