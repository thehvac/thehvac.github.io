<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a reasonably simple to determine surrogate for indoor pollutants released by human beings, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are unusually high indoors might trigger occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in the majority of structures. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding noises. Though most air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units may be belt-driven.

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
