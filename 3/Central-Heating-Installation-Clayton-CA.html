<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.
