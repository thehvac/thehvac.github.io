<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
