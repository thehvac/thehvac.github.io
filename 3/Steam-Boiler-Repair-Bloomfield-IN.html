<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
