<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services at Canonsburg PA</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on different house performance upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took adequate time to assist us debate which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest cost savings. We never ever felt hurried and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's items and services was excellent. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a reasonable level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to perform the necessary electrical improvements to minimize cost.<p>
<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate since it has to run longer than a correctly sized system. Since it simply takes more electrical energy to run a larger unit, a large-scale compressor also costs more to operate. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down prior to it has a possibility to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the essential wetness. The result is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature level indicates. In truth, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
