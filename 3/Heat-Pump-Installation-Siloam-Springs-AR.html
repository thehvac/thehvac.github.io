<p>If the condenser coils are clogged, the compressor can shut and overheat down. You'll experience periodic durations of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are clean, clean them once again. Turn off the power. Flip the a/c service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Photo 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Picture 2).
