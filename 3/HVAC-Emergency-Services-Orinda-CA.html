<p>When our furnace was passing away, we called two local companies for quotes. While both were informative and valuable, Ballard Gas gave us a much better offer, for exceptional service. Rather than a simple sales job, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heating system and located methods we might have more even heat. He consisted of these small but substantial modifications in his quote. Because of current warmer summers and for ecological reasons, we decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
<p>We have actually been exceptionally happy with Integrity's devices (Trane dealer) and service (today Braxten finished yearly maintenance of our system).
