Older systems from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a fairly simple procedure. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting, setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather pricey.<p>
