<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor system as near your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
