<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals.

<p>The primary factor homeowners do not purchase an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 each year, depending on the quantity of services offered.

However, some producers need regular maintenance as a term of the service warranty.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transmitted by individuals and animals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander.

Infected central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>
