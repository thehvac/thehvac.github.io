<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace at Doylestown OH</h3>

They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they had to buy it. My other half said that she had seen an excellent evaluation for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall.
