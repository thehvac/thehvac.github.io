<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide car debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash coming in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide car debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>My oldest child constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I realized that it actually didnâ $ t disperse air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really consider anything else other than changing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The sound level is itâ and low $ s terrific on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious aspect impacting indoor air quality, however it is typically used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a space or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too expensive-- which can have an unfavorable influence on occupants-- outside air needs to be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
