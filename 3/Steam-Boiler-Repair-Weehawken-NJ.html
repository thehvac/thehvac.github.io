<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step.
