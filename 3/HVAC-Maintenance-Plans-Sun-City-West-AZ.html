<h3>Assessing Commercial Boilers to Residential Boilers at Sun City West AZ</h3>
<p>Elements that can add to the development of biological contaminants are wet or wet building materials (carpets, ceilings, walls) and badly maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners. "Humidifier fever" is a typical disease caused by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs. Various fungis and germs grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these contaminants can be dispersed into the air and inhaled by the building residents. Other possible sources of biological impurities are pets and household plants.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not provide them.. Second of all like extended vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required skills to do the task and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found somebody to correctly service and the system has been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
