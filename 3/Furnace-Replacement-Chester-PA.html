Among the primary locations where blockages begin to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
