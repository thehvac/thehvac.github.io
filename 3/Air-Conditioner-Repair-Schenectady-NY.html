<h3>Some Useful Strategies To Follow If You Want To Update Your Central Heating Boiler in Schenectady NY</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really delighted that somebody as experienced as Adam was able to return and repair the air conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to check the a/c unit prior to you buy. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam stated he had methods to test AC systems even in winter. We want we had understood him then.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
