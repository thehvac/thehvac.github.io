<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must temporarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
