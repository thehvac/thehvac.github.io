<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them till they have actually been properly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up. Attempt a various dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent gos to.<p>
