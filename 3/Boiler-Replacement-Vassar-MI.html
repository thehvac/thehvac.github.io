<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the job based only on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few sensible ones got. Others were almost two times the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The install team was considerate of my house and set up the equipment in the expected quantity of time. post set up inspection results look great for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools better than the 13 year old 4 heap R22 unit it replaced (also Provider).<p>
<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have actually discovered them to be fairly priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was necessary and redid the whole plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater because the technicians believed they simply didn't appear right and they couldn't leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>
