<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you need to inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
