<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature level of the floor. All wiring for your radiant heat system either runs to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the room they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is great as long as the location is unblocked and dry.<p>
<p>Oil furnaces are generally not very efficient. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, but most do not accomplish an efficiency greater than 90%. A couple of high-end brands have a performance of 95% by utilizing a condenser. These are more pricey, having beginning costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. You pay more for the installation too since a drain needs to be installed.<p>
