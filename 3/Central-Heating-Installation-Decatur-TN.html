<p>Enhance your services, earn more services income, and supply an amazing client experience. To make sure the unit you select is the best size for your home, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load calculation estimate to figure out the specific type of heat and cooling system that's ideal for your home-we do not simply replace it with the very same size unit you presently have. These estimations consider things such as the size of your house, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is necessary so the system isn't too little or too large-both waste energy.<p>

<p>Terrific Product! Delivery was type of strange being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The item was extremely lite weight and takes time to use. Keep in mind: purchase recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we fixed problems. I would suggest this item to anybody who's renovating or installing their restroom for the very first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
