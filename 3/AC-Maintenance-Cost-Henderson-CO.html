After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
