Temperature level levels should range from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30% and 60%. In addition, drafts brought on by excessive air flow ought to be avoided. Maintenance of appropriate temperature levels and humidity levels and correct air circulation will assist to decrease the occurrence of upper breathing symptoms, and, potentially, skin rashes.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
