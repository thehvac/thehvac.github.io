<p>EHSI's indoor air quality team masters incorporating a multidisciplinary technique to indoor air quality (IAQ) obstacles.

<p>Due to the fact that it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your house through ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for performance. Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion procedure. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly simple procedure. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather costly if you are including on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
