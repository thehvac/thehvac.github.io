<p>You're encouraging the growth of mold in moist air if you set it too low. The heat dries out the air, avoiding mold development and pollution. Naturally, too-dry air can also irritate your sinuses and lungs, while too much indoor humidity can contribute to the growth of bacteria and infections, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a home is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>A car's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being unclean and old. The old coolant will negatively impact the system's performance. To make sure the system is working successfully, think about having a regular coolant system flush. A coolant flush is standard maintenance for your car's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or visit Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill needs.<p>

<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in sufficient outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
