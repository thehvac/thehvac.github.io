<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them till they have actually been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. If items with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent sees, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
