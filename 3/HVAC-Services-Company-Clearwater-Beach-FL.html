<p>Due to the fact that it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your home by means of ducts, and cool air is gathered by means of cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for performance. Older systems from the 1970s may be ranked 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly uncomplicated process.

<p>It is not advised that "regular" occupational exposure limits (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be used to figure out if the basic indoor air quality fulfills a particular requirement. Occupational direct exposure limits listed in health and wellness regulations and the Threshold Limit Values ® (TLVs) suggested by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are intended as a guide to avoid illness or specific effects (like eye and nose inflammation) in industrial scenarios. These limits may not be appropriate in workplace settings or for the house.<p>
