<p>If you're in the very first couple of years of company, you might choose to keep your product and services line simple in the meantime.

This decreases the interior system footprint and permits each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adjusted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heat pump While space cooling supplies maximum versatility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is usually more expensive than central air.<p>
