<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a recommendation later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
