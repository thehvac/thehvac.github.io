<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller house, which will affect installation costs. Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfy. Other elements that can affect this could be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
