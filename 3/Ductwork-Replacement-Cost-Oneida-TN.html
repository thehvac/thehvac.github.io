<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance at Oneida TN</h3>
<p>Most people know that outside air pollution can affect their health, but indoor air contamination can likewise have considerable, hazardous impact. EPA research studies of human exposure to air pollutants show that indoor levels of contaminants might be two to five times-- and occasionally more than 100 times-- higher than outside levels.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
