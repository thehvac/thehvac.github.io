<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Design, Construction and Commissioning is designed for architects, style engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other professionals interested in indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house include structure materials, smoking cigarettes, home items, and using unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene area heating systems.

<p>Not all sensing units work the same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes.

You get instant, real-time access to the tracking results through a control panel, which turns the data into visual charts that are simple to figure out.<p>

<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of visible development or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Leaky return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
