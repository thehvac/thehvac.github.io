<p>The pollutants listed in this guide have been shown to cause the health effects discussed. However, it is not always true that the impacts kept in mind take place at the pollutant concentration levels usually discovered in the house. In many cases, our understanding of the toxins and their health effects is too restricted to identify the levels at which the listed effects could take place.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce toxins.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
