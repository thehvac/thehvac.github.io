<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you should examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
