<p>It might feel cozy being sealed in tight against the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, but for people who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have breathing problems, winter season can worsen problems. Stale indoor air and heating unit can increase the quantity of allergy-inducing allergen, animal dander, and mold spores distributing through your home. In late winter and early spring, it might still be too cold to throw open the windows to take out the musty air, so while you wait for the warmer weather it is very important to be aware of some of the allergic reaction and breathing triggers that may be lurking in your surroundings.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might want to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump units can have different heating and cooling capacities. If you currently have a home heater, you may look for a heatpump more geared toward cooling capability and efficiency. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to look for a design that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The good news is that the one major disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or extremely hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house residents. Unlike other types of ac system, evaporative coolers depend on the outside air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its duct system; this cooled outside air should be enabled to press the warmer air within your home out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically basic to preserve and understand.<p>
