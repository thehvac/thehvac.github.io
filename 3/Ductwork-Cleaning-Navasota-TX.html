<h3>Furnace Installation Near me in Navasota Texas</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the see. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap however a fast web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the see or the new part.

<p>Excellent Item! Shipment was sort of weird being that package was opened and products could have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The product was extremely lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: buy advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we resolved concerns. I would recommend this product to anybody who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
