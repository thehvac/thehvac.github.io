<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace specialists typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you may not have a problem as long as your house still warms to the right temperature level. The temperature level of the air produced by the heatpump will not necessarily be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it may not feel really hot. Only be worried if your home is not warming up. However, if your system does not appear to be working effectively, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you must call in an expert to repair the system and inspect.<p>
