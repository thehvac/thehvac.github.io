<p>We're Not Just Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Building-Related Health Problem (BRI) describes less frequent (however frequently more serious) cases of individuals ending up being ill after being in a specific structure at a particular time. In these cases, there is generally a similar set of clinical symptoms experienced by the people and a clear cause can typically be found upon investigation. Legionnaires Disease is an example of BRI triggered by bacteria which can pollute a building's air conditioning system.<p>
<p>More common in relatively older homes, a boiler-based heating system uses gas, oil or electrical energy to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in specific spaces. All-electric boilers can attain up to 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers should attain 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers need to attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<p>IAQ can be impacted by gases (including carbon monoxide, radon, volatile natural compounds ), particulates, microbial contaminants (mold, germs ), or any mass or energy stressor that can cause unfavorable health conditions. Source control, filtration and making use of ventilation to dilute contaminants are the main methods for improving indoor air quality in many structures. Residential units can further improve indoor air quality by routine cleaning of carpets and rug.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just 8 to ten years old, it might flatter twice the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's since it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to supply a particular cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than devices installed simply a couple of years ago.<p>
