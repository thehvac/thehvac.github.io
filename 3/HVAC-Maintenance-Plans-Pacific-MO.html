<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps at Pacific MO</h3>
<p>Dunes Heating And Cooling is HVAC Contractor providing the best possible Heating and A/c Repair, maintenance and installation for your home or service in Mount Pleasant, Charleston and Isle of Palms South Carolina. You can count on us to supply you with a system and solution that fits your unique needs and given that we've set up many systems in this area, we have actually made a reputation for getting the job done right the first time.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Equipment costs are driven by the type of furnace at the heart of your house heating unit. Low-efficiency models will cost less, however lead to greater energy bills. High-efficiency designs cost more, however conserve more over the long run. Prices for gas heating systems range from $1,360 for the low-efficiency models up to $12,500 for high-efficiency designs. Electric furnaces start at $395 and vary approximately $1,700 or more depending on the brand name and furnace size.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps just as important when it pertains to central air conditioning costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not have the ability to appropriately cool the home on hot days. Considering larger units cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air system requires to hold.<p>
<p>This review is for replacing a 17 years of age AC with a new AC, humidifier, air filtration system and thermostat. The technician who explained our choices did an outstanding job in making sure we comprehended the advantages and disadvantages of each option. The professionals who installed the brand-new system were professional and quick, while taking time to make certain we understood how the brand-new system worked. In general a first rate experience.<p>
