The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects toxins from indoor air (expressed as a percentage performance rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering aspect (revealed in cubic feet per minute). A really efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-lasting efficiency of any air cleaner depends on maintaining it according to the maker's instructions.<p>

Dirty filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases trigger the system to shut down totally. By contrast, checking and replacing a furnace filter can normally be done in just a few minutes, often with no tools needed. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, generally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
