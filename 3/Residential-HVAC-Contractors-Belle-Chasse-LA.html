<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are sent by people and animals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander.

Contaminated central air handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these impurities through the house.<p>
