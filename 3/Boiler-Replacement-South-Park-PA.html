<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>

While there aren't many repairs you can make yourself, there specify maintenance procedures you can follow to keep your system operating at peak efficiency.<p>
