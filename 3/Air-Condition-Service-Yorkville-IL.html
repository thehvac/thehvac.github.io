<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his staff members, devices expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't sound like much, especially if the goal of owning a business was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't the end goal. HVAC entrepreneur need to strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the exact same in all other areas.<p>
