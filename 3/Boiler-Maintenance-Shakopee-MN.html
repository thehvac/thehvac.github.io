<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

There are several types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this. A common element needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
