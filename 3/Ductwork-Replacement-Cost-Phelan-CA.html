<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either because of noticeable growth or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
