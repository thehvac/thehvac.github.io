<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
