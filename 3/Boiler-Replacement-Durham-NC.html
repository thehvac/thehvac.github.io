Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure.

<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, managing the power to the heating wires and likewise managing the temperature level of the floor. All electrical wiring for your radiant heating system either goes to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entryway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the location is unobstructed and dry.<p>
<p>Fantastic service within 24 hours and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was very extensive and on-time in discussing what services would be performed. Similarly Camryn supplied excellent customer care at the end of the appointment by explaining exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of suggestions of some maintenance tasks we might wish to have carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale strategies utilized by some in the market.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might wish to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heatpump units can have different heating and cooling capabilities. If you currently have a house heater, you might look for a heatpump more tailored towards cooling capability and effectiveness. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to try to find a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The good news is that the one major drawback of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or extremely hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
