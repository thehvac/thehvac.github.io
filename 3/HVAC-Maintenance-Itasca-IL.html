<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
