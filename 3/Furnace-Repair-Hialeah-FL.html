<p>I have been using them for many years for my organisations, my own homes and my realty clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he advised me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again, he helped me trouble shoot the concern. He is sincere, trustworthy, and affordable on rate. It's difficult to find a sincere AC person and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>
