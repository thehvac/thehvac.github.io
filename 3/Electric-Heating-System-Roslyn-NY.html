<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
