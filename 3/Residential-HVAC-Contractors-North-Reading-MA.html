<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain.
