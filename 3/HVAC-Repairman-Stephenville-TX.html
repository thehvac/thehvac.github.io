<p>Power Vac America supplies commercial, industrial, institutional, residential and marine air duct cleaning and HVAC system cleaning company. The essential part of your cooling is the outside unit.

Your Sacramento HVAC technician will clean off the outside of the system and ensure that there is no rust, damage from built up moisture, or extreme wear to the exterior. They might advise that you trim thick trees or bushes to make sure appropriate air flow around the system.<p>
