<p>The primary health effect related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
