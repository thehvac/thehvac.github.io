<p>The impacts of lead direct exposure on fetuses and kids can be severe. They consist of delays in mental and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Kids, fetuses, and infants are more susceptible to lead exposure than adults given that lead is more easily taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the harmful impacts of lead. Children might have greater exposures given that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>

<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the room temperature, and after that change it ON. To avoid straining an a/c's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
