<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
