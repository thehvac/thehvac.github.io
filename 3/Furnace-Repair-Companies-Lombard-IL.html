<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>1. Central Air Source Heat Pumps Air source heatpump work best in a mild environment, where the temperature doesn't get too expensive or too low.
