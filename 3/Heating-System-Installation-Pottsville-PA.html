Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are often described as merely glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating elements installed in the subfloor of each space in the home, periodically linked to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
