<p>Brian was every bit truthful, responsive and pleasant. Jeremiah Bartula the plumber discussed our alternatives prior to our work with Brian and was extraordinary, useful and helpful - his work was remarkable! All of his assistants were conscientious and respectful. The work website was left absolutely cleared and cleaned. We would highly encourage others to go right to Berkshire Heating and A/c for all their heating and cooling needs.<p>
<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the very same. When the wiring is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly solidify and treat-- typically 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have problems, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
