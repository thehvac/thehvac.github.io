Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do decline them till they have actually been effectively dried. If goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent gos to, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
