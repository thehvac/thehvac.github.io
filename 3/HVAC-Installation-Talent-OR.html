<h3>HVAC Company in Talent OR 97540</h3>
<p>I have been using them for years for my businesses, my own houses and my real estate customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with different costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he recommended me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again, he helped me problem shoot the concern. He is honest, reputable, and reasonable on rate. It's tough to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be revealing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for seven years, despite the fact that it was 6 months before the existing one ended.
