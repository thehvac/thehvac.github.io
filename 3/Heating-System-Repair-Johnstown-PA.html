<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, houses and offices matters, particularly because we spend most of our lives indoors. A/c assist to dehumidify the incoming air, but in incredibly humid environments or in cases where the a/c unit is oversized, it might not attain a low humidity.

<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ problem. Your company must inspect measurements of air, temperature level and humidity flow. In addition, evaluation and testing of the ventilation, heating and a/c systems (to make certain it is working according to requirements for developing usage and occupancy) must be carried out. A building walk-through to look for smells and look for water damage, leaks, dirt or bug droppings might be useful. Leaks need to be eliminated. Standing water in humidifiers, a/c systems, on roofings and in boiler pans can become infected with bacteria or fungis and require to be removed, likewise. In some scenarios, specific screening for radon or for asbestos might be needed as part of building occupancy. For example, in schools asbestos needs to be examined every 3 years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Threat Emergency Action Act-AHERA).<p>
