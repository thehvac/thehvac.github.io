<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning On Your Wilkes Barre PA Home</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes far more severe with lower outdoor temperature levels, so heat pumps are typically installed in tandem with a more standard type of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heatpump throughout harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heatpump is utilized efficiently during the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the traditional heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
