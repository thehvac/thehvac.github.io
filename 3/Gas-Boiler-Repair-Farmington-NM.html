<p>SysTech Style concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>Oil heating units are less common now than natural gas, but they can be helpful in more remote regions where energies are more difficult to gain access to, and in cooler climates due to the fact that it supplies more heat per BTU than other solutions.

They require a tank on the immediate property and more maintenance. Overall, they cost in between $2,000 and $8,000 to install. Overall, they offer an AFUE rating of between 80 and 90 percent.<p>
