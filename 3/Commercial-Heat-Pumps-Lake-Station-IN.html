<h3>HVAC Maintenance in Lake Station IN 46405</h3>
<p>We needed 2 visits - Jake came out initially and was pleasant and extremely educated and respectful. Grant came out a couple days later on and was great and likewise knowledgeable to talk with.

<p>There are a few possibilities to discuss short biking in extremely cold weather. The most obvious is the possibility of the high demands placed on the system due to the extremely low temperature levels. Often, the furnace will simply run harder to preserve a warm climate for your house when the weather is extremely cold. There are other possibilities such as a fracture in the heat exchanger or a broken thermostat. If you need clearness on this issue, contact one of our technicians.<p>
<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO preserve the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales methods that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>The predominant health result associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
