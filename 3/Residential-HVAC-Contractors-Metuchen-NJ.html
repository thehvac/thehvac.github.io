I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the go to or the brand-new part. I was extremely pleased they waited their work and fixed the problem. Will certainly be using them once again.<p>
