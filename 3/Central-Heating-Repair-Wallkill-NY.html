<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping between a outside and indoor system rather of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit.

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend used in cars in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be bought and utilized by licensed HVAC specialists. For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by many individuals.<p>
