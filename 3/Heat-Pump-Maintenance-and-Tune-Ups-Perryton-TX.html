<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the primary issue. While installing a different split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more difficulties, since some of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the a/c individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>
