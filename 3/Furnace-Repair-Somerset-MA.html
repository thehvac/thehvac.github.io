<p>I had an awful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Additionally, the company utilized 98% of the existing product purchased with your house. This company presented a service arrangement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and plumbing. Throughout the evaluation on an extremely cold day they eliminated the furnace claiming health hazard reason and contractor laws for their decision. As a new homeowner I have learned how to identify the sincere HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you might require a referral in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
