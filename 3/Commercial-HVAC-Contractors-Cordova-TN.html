The majority of furnaces will last in between 15 and 20 years. In choosing a furnace, homeowner should think about heat output and effectiveness.

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a reference later). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
