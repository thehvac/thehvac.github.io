<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by building, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures through mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Only a specialist can accurately detect why your furnace isn't starting. It's time to call a professional if at any point in the procedure of bleeding the furnace something seems weird or you lose confidence. Likewise, if the process doesn't work, something else is incorrect and you need a technician to analyze the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you discover you have to do it often, it's probably time for a professional opinion.<p>
