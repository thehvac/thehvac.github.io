No evidence exists recommending that in-floor heating either positively or adversely affects property values. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the yearly Cost vs. Worth Report issued by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Renovation Magazine. Perhaps Real estate agents must consider a lot of variables to definitively mention what a radiant heating system may add to, or deduct from, any provided asking price.
