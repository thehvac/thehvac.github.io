An example of time control is setting up flooring stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday. This enables items to off-gas over the weekend while the majority of the personnel are at house over the weekend. Location control involves moving the contaminant source far from residents or perhaps moving susceptible residents.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it could grovel two times the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's since it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to offer a particular cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment set up simply a few years ago.<p>
