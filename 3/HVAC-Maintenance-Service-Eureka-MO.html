<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Filters can get dirty easily, especially if you reside in a place that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, debris, germs, and clean the air. They're responsible for maintaining the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned up and changed routinely, your HVAC system will ultimately stop carrying out as you anticipate it to. The cooling and heating will mishandle and the indoor air quality will intensify. Examining and changing the air filters is among the most essential aspects of HVAC maintenance.<p>
