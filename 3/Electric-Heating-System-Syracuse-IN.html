<p>A specific air conditioning system that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic air conditioner because both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the exact same air path. Because its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. Nevertheless, because all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the very same space, no heat energy is removed. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is really heated up, simply as by an electric heater that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
