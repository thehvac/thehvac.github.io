<p>Professional heater setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heater will eventually stop working. HVAC specialists advise following this basic rule when choosing whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than required.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate fantastic however Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
