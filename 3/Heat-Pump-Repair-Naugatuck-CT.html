<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the see. They suggested changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost but a quick web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the visit or the new part.
