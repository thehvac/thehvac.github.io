<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. Over time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you want to get those capacitors altered to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
