<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.
