<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
