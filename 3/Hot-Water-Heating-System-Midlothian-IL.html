<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is absorbed from inside your home and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
