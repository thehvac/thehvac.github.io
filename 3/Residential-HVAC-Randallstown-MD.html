<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to discover a location that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Due to the fact that it exhausts warm air out the top, do not position the condenser under a deck or completely enclose it. Any air flow restriction will lower the unit's performance.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
