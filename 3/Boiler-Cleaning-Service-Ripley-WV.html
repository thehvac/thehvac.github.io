<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either since of visible development or a musty smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Leaking return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>I generally do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
