<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline banned making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
