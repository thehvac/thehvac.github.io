<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol impact, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly placed or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which might get in nearby ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and retirement home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor water fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water materials is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
