<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either because of visible development or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't remove the mold.

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide must be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements utilized for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might likewise be required.<p>
