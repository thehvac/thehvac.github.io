<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Fredericktown MO</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even little window bundle systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or cleaned as conditions warrant.

Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. In addition, really filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
