<h3>Factors to Consider When Searching for a Good AC Repair Company at Leominster MA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
