<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut off completely.<p>

You get instant, real-time access to the tracking results via a dashboard, which turns the data into visual charts that are easy to understand.<p>
