<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

If that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the part.  a very useful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
