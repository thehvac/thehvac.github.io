<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that determine the height and width of the opening. When going shopping for an air conditioner to ensure it'll fit comfortably into the window, be sure to have those measurements on hand. Likewise, keep fire safety in mind when deciding where to set up the air conditioning unit: Don't position it in an egress window that acts as the only ways of escape should a fire erupt.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might wish to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump systems can have different heating and cooling capabilities. If you already have a home heating system, you might search for a heat pump more tailored toward cooling capacity and efficiency.
