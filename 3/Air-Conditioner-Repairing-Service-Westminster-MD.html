<h3>The Basics of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Westminster MD</h3>

<p>Many factors affect IAQ. These elements consist of bad ventilation (absence of outside air), problems controlling temperature level, low or high humidity, current renovation, and other activities in or near a structure that can affect the fresh air entering into the structure. In some cases, specific contaminants like dust from construction or renovation, mold, cleaning supplies, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (including small amounts of chemicals released as a gas in time) may cause bad IAQ.<p>

The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
