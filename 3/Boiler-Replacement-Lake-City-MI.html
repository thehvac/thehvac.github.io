<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, workers try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more difficulties, given that a few of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the a/c individually for each space. However, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems run separately from each other.<p>
