<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside unit as near the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>HVAC Services Near Me in Liberal KS 67901</h3>
<p>The federal government advises that houses be weatherized in order to decrease the quantity of energy required for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, however, actions need to also be required to decrease pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for suggested actions.) In addition, citizens need to be alert to the development of indications of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew development. Extra weatherization measures need to not be carried out till these issues have been corrected.<p>
<p>Prior to you head out and buy an a/c, there are a few things to choose initially. Where are you going to be setting up the a/c? If your home is not equipped with ductwork, do you wish to set up some or go ductless? How large should the a/c be? Too large and you'll run into problems with short-cycling, which can harm the a/c and shorten its life. Too small and your a/c won't have the ability to cool your home appropriately. When going shopping for a new AC system, these are simply a few of the factors that you need to take into account. Each choice can and will significantly impact your system's efficiency, which is why you can't afford to overlook any of them.<p>
