<p>Filters can get dirty easily, especially if you reside in a location that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, particles, bacteria, and clean the air. They are accountable for preserving the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned and replaced frequently, your HVAC system will ultimately stop performing as you expect it to. The cooling and heating will be inefficient and the indoor air quality will get worse. Examining and changing the air filters is one of the most essential elements of HVAC maintenance.<p>
<p>The primary health result associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may position threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your threat of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
