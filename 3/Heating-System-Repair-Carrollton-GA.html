<h3>Fixing Your Boiler in Carrollton GA</h3>
<p>Before you select a contractor, think about bids from a minimum of three to five reputable contractors. Check with your state's contractor's licensing board online to make sure that no client complaints have been submitted which the heating and air-conditioning contracting license is active and valid. Compare the different furnace effectiveness ratings suggested by the individual contractors to select the design and system that finest suits your energy needs. Bear in mind that energy-star rated equipment will conserve you money in the end but may involve a higher up-front cost.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
