<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power must not surpass the capability of the outside unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor systems higher than the outside capacity by at least 20%. However, it is incorrect to expect better efficiency when all indoor systems are switched on at the same time, given that the total capacity of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outdoor system. Basically, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that a few of the spaces might not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the estimation of the overall power is not simple, considering that it considers not only the nominal power of the units, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
