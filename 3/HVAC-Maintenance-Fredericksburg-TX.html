<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Maintenance in Fredericksburg Texas</h3>
<p>If you think a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a musty smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and check. Leaky return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>For pollutants besides radon, measurements are most appropriate when there are either health signs or signs of bad ventilation and particular sources or pollutants have been identified as possible causes of indoor air quality issues. Evaluating for numerous toxins can be costly. Before monitoring your home for contaminants besides radon, consult your state or local health department or experts who have experience in resolving indoor air quality problems in nonindustrial structures.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Lowering pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outdoor) air to water down polluted (indoor) air. Local building codes likely define the amount (and sometimes quality) of outside air that must be continuously provided in your buildings, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Temporarily increasing ventilation coupled with correct use of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for example, can be useful in watering down the concentration of harmful fumes in the air.<p>
