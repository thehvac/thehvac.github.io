<h3>Why Fall Is Your Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System in Bloomfield NM</h3>
<p>Whether it's the middle of winter or summer season, having a working HVAC system is important. At Lowe's, we have a range of heating and cooling systems-- from heaters and heat pumps to window air conditioners and portable air conditioning unit Plus, we offer cooling installation and heating installation by certified expert independent installers.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
