<p>As with many home improvement projects, the cost of a full central heater can vary commonly based on the size of the home. A lot of furnaces will last in between 15 and 20 years. In choosing a furnace, property owners must think about heat output and efficiency. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the home. A small house, for example, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the home too quickly and shut off for too long, resulting in irregular temperature levels.<p>
