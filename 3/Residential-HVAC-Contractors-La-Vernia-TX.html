The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and preserve. Leaky return ducts can likewise present moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
