<p>Irritants are materials that cause an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mostly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can become airborne, and hence, are easily inhaled. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to provide adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A typical aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
