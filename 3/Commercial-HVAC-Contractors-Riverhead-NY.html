<p>Examine these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in your home are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The reduced air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the problem.<p>
