<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

<p>Reality: Geothermal systems really take in no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are extremely unusual now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually get rid of countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>Whatever heater you install, it's vital that it's sized properly for your home. Too big and you'll be paying more for devices and installation than you should. Plus, it will utilize excessive energy for the quantity of heat you desire produced. If the system is too small, then your house will not be warmed sufficiently and the system will have to constantly run to attempt to heat the whole home, which will increase heating expenses.<p>
<p>Geothermal heating is a clever and cost-efficient  method to add heat to your house or business.
