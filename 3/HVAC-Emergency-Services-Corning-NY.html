<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a reference later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
