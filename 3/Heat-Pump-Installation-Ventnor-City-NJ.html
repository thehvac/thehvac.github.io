<p>, if the hvac company didn't come out ahead they would not offer agreements.. The so called credible companies dupe more people than the fly by night clothing. I understand since I attempted to work for them. Because 90% of them are criminals, I give up. They stroll in with or without a contract and start offering you things you do not require. They lie. How do I understand. I now work as an expert to confirm the so called solutions and problems. 9 out of 10, I inspect are completely wrong.<p>
<p>There is a required balance in making your choice though as systems with higher AFUE ratings often feature greater price tags. So, make certain to choose based upon how often you will utilize your heating unit, the load that will be put on it and the frequency with which you plan on having it serviced each year. For most temperate environments with low heating loads in the winter, having a very high ranked heating unit is not always needed.<p>
<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in on a monthly basis, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide automobile debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There need to not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
