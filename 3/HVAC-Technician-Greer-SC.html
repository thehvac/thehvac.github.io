<h3>Choosing Commercial HVAC Repair Services in Greer SC</h3>
<p>I admit I have not done the math lately, but I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine assessments. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the patio where the unit sits. I feel like they offer me preferential treatment, and want to pay a bit more for that comfort.<p>
<p>Because an ac system moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both must be kept clean. This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise necessary to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
