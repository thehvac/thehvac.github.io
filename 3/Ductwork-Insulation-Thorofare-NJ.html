<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, select your contractor carefully, many of the 'trusted' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales strategies that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a respectable company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you ought to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
