<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
