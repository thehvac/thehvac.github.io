<p>While radon in water is not an issue in homes served by the majority of public water products, it has been discovered in well water. If you have actually checked the air in your house and found a radon issue, and you have a well, get in touch with a laboratory licensed to determine radiation in water to have your water checked. Radon issues in water can be easily fixed. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to find out more.<p>
<p>This is particularly significant, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with inadequately adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>PE firms tend to operate with the goal of selling or spinning off a firm at some point. This could be through a public offering, a sale to a large company in the field, and even a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management. Ares purchased CoolSys from Audex, another PE company, previously this year. Audex had owned CoolSys for 3 years prior to that.<p>

However more intricate issues-- recognized by consistently inappropriate air quality monitoring results-- will need a various tack.
