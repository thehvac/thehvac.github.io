<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets ask for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>A regular furnace tune up can take full advantage of efficiency and provide longer long lasting house heating. Nevertheless, there are times when a simple maintenance call can identify a concern that will need a considerable investment to fix. Then, it's choice time. Do you make the pricey repair and delight in continued comfort from your current heating system? Or, do you make an even bigger financial commitment to changing the furnace? The decision to repair or replace is up to you, and frequently it's a matter of comparing the cost to repair, considering the age of the devices, versus the cost of a new furnace that likely provides higher energy effectiveness and features service warranty protection.<p>
