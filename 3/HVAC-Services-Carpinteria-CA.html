He helped me difficulty shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again. He is sincere, reliable, and sensible on rate. It's hard to find an honest AC guy and I'm happy I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
