<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- provide All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work very well in temperate climates like King and South Snohomish counties. Working on electrical energy, a heatpump is an affordable solution using a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your refrigerator, but in reverse. Rather of warming or cooling the air already inside your home, it draws heat or cool from the air outside and pushes it through the ventilation system of your house.<p>
<p>The first air conditioning system and fridges employed hazardous or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might lead to fatal accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion home and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
