<h3>Common Reasons For Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Mechanicsville VA</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even little window bundle units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or washed as conditions call for.

Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Additionally, really dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
