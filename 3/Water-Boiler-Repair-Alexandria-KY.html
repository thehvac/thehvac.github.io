<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Alexandria KY?</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are extremely efficient, due to the fact that ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature level is always at a consistent temperature. These systems can obtain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just obtain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Just like other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE OFFICER). COP rates how much heat a system produces or gets rid of (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling effect. Most ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this indicates is that for every single system of energy utilized by a geothermal heat pump, roughly 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the type of heat.<p>
