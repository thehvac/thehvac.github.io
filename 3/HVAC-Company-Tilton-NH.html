<p>Consumer items that contain methylene chloride consist of paint strippers, adhesive eliminators, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is understood to cause cancer in animals. Also, methylene chloride is transformed to carbon monoxide in the body and can trigger signs connected with exposure to carbon monoxide gas.

<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off contaminants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transferred by people and animals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
