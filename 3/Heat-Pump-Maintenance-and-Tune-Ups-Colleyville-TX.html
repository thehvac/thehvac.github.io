<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>They were fantastic! Numerous HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially requested.
