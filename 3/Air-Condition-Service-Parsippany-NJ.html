<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price excellent however Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
