<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
