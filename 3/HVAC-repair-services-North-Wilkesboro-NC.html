<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
