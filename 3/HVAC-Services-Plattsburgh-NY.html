<p>Your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a variety of contaminants that have the potential to negatively affect your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and really small particles of dust.

<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on similar principles.
