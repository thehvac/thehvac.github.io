<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
