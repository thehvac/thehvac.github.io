<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do decline them till they have been correctly dried. Try a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
