<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not provide them.. Second of all like prolonged automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat clients fairly. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair.
