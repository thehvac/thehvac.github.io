<h3>Designing Tips to Central Heating Systems in North Adams MA</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present pattern in home building and construction is to lower air leakage through fractures and other openings in floorings, roofs, and walls. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor contaminants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
