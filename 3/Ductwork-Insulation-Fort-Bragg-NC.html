Older units from the 1970s may be rated 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is squandered throughout the combustion procedure. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly straightforward process. If you are including on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting, setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite pricey.<p>

Sears HVAC installation experts are certified, bonded and insured, and they follow all local and local policies and codes. We ensure your fulfillment, and provide a product service warranty and manufacturer-backed installation warranty-- it's service you can depend on for many years to come.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't provide them.. Secondly like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat customers fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to appropriately service and the unit has been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
