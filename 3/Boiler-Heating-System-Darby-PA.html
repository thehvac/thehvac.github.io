<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or two. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to removing the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Photo 6).<p>

<p>If you think a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and preserve. Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Some health effects may show up shortly after a single direct exposure or duplicated exposures to a contaminant. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such immediate effects are normally short-term and treatable. Sometimes the treatment is simply eliminating the individual's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be recognized. Not long after direct exposure to some indoor air toxins, symptoms of some illness such as asthma may show up, be exacerbated or worsened.<p>
<p>I had a terrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Furthermore, the company utilized 98% of the existing material acquired with your house. This company presented a service agreement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and plumbing. During the evaluation on a really cold day they eliminated the furnace declaring health risk factor and contractor laws for their decision. As a new homeowner I have found out how to determine the sincere HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
