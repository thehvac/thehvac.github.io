<p>Examine these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in the house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The lowered airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
