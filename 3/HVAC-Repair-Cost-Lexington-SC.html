<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate terrific but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

Zones are managed by multiple thermostats.

In this case, the control system is extremely critical to preserving an appropriate temperature.<p>
