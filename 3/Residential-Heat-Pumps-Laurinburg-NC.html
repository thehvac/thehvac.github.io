<p>We're spending a lot more time inside, these days. While lots of people presume contamination is just an outdoor issue, your home (and workplace) can also be contaminated. As a society, we make sure that our homes are well-insulated and well-sealed, however we don't think sufficient about direct exposure to all the important things we place in our houses," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around buildings and structures has a big result on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, queasiness-- immediately, they can come on years after direct exposure, according to the federal Epa (EPA). Here's how to breathe easier.<p>
<p>It is not recommended that "regular" occupational exposure limits (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be used to identify if the basic indoor air quality fulfills a specific requirement. Occupational exposure limitations listed in health and wellness guidelines and the Threshold Limit Worths ® (TLVs) advised by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are planned as a guide to prevent illness or certain impacts (like eye and nose irritation) in commercial situations. These limitations may not be suitable in office settings or for the house.<p>
