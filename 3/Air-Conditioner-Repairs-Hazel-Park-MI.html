<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is minimized, but it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be quite considerable.<p>

I have 2 heaters - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
