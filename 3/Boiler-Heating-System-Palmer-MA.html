<p>Current Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
