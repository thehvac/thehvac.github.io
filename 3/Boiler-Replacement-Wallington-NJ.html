<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical material gradually. In fact, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
