<p>Trace was the service technician that looked after my semi annual maintenance today. Trace was on time, courteous, and appreciated my house by constantly wearing boot coverings when entering my home. He showed the points of inspection and also advised I have a UV light installed due to a little buildup of mold building up in the air handler, which he completely cleaned up the exterior and inspected compressor coils in addition to ensured the moisture discharge tube was clear by utilizing a cleaning liquid and a shop vacuum. He likewise got rid of the leaves that collected inside the interior of the compressor system and suggested an option to avoid it from continuing, which will do.I received a comprehensive email report of the evaluation laying out all the electronic measurements and service.Trace is a property to Waychoff's and I extremely suggest him and Waychoff's for service and installation.<p>
<p>There is a necessary balance in making your decision though as systems with higher AFUE ratings often feature higher price tags. So, ensure to choose based upon how often you will utilize your heater, the load that will be put on it and the frequency with which you intend on having it serviced each year.

<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a difficult job that the employees sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps men working. When a sales male concerns your home he exists to sell, that is the only way he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and should not "need" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on.
