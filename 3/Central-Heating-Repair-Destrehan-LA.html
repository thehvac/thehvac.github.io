<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my services, my own homes and my realty customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He helped me problem shoot the concern when I called and he recommended me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again. He is honest, trustworthy, and affordable on cost. It's tough to find an honest AC man and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
