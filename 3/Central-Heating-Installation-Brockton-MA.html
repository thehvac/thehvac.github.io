<p>I have actually been using them for years for my companies, my own houses and my real estate clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again, he helped me trouble shoot the issue. He is honest, reputable, and reasonable on price. It's difficult to find a truthful AC person and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
