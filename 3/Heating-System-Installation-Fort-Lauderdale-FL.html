And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts revealed and re-installed the detach block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

You do not have the tools, or the proficiency, to be sure that you carry out those treatments securely and properly. Professionals, however, do have the tools and knowledge to do the job properly.
