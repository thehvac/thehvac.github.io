<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Because it exhausts warm air out the top, do not put the condenser under a deck or entirely confine it. Any airflow constraint will decrease the unit's efficiency. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>My eldest kid constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I realized that it truly didnâ $ t disperse air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually consider anything else other than changing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The sound level is itâ and low $ s great on energy saving too.<p>
