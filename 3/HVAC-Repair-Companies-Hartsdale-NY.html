Indoor air quality isn't on many people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a danger to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a current study by the Customer Reports National Research Center. However a lot of the things individuals do-- or do not do-- can add to the stew of airborne contaminants in their houses and get worse asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>

<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it could flatter two times the electricity that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's due to the fact that it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to provide a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices installed simply a few years earlier.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
