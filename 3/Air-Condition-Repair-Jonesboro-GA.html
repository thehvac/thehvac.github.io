<h3>Pool Heat Pump in Jonesboro GA 30236</h3>
<p>I have been using them for several years for my businesses, my own homes and my real estate customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with different rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again. He is truthful, reputable, and sensible on cost. It's hard to find an honest AC guy and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
