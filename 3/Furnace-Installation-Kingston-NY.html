Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>Chemical contaminants: Unpredictable natural compounds ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are numerous, varied, and common. They include both human-made and naturally happening chemical substances. Chemical contaminants can include tobacco smoke, emissions from items utilized in the building (e.g., workplace equipment; wall, furnishings and flooring coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer products) unintentional spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
