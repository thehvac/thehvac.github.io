<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window.

You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>
<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that may impact the health of individuals who reside in the house. Pollutants could come from outside the house-- such as an idling car engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon entering your home from the ground listed below. An air toxin might likewise come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, volatile organic substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on damp or moist carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or individual care products. Bacteria and viruses, family pet dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Irritants are materials that cause an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these products. Allergens discovered in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can end up being airborne, and hence, are easily breathed in. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you think of a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of feline irritant could induce an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>The predominant health result associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
