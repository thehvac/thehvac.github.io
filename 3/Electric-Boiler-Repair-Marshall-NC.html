<h3>Things to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service at Marshall NC</h3>
<p>After living in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the air conditioning. I went on and purchased this Carrier and I should say it gets the job done rather well. It takes very little time to heat up or cool down your house which is one of the important things we didnâ $ t get from the one we had previously. The system hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things first. Ensure all the signs up in the house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the lowered airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the problem.<p>
