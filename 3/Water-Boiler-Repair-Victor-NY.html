<p>Sean was very handy. He is an extremely enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure applied to purchase extra stuff. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no issues aside from the blower motor. The only factor he could not install the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
