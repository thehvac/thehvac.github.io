<h3>AC Maintenance Cost in Easley SC 29640</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for years for my businesses, my own houses and my real estate clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. He helped me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again. He is truthful, reliable, and sensible on cost. It's tough to find a truthful AC person and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>While these actions will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance items that only a qualified HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can lead to expensive compressor failure, however a homeowner does not have the tools or abilities required to examine refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and appropriate air flow are necessary to a well-functioning system, however homeowners lack the required devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still necessary to have a specialist technician inspect the system occasionally.<p>

He followed through and went the extra mile to personally get a required part that was not in stock, ensuring repairs were made so that my partner and I would not need to endure another night without heat, during one of the coldest winter seasons in recent memory.

I rely on Nick's skills, experience and capability to provide consistent, quality service.<p>
