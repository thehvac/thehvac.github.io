<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
