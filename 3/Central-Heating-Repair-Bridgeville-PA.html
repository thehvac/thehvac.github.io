Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits. I seem like they give me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
