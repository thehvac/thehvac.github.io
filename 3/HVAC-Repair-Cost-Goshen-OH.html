<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everyone can pay for, many Seattleites must discover ways to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in huge box shops like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are taken up as quickly as they're stacked in floor displays. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to deal with the truth of a terrible, vicious summer season.<p>
