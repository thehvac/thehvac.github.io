<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor unit as near to the house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)

<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>It is also advised for locals of Redmond to have access to heating unit inside their homes. Throughout the winter seasons, heaters provide adequate heating power to houses in the community. The typical daytime temperature level highs during December, January, and February range from the mid-40s to low-50s. Temperatures will drop listed below freezing at night, and heavy rainfall is common during the cold weather. When correctly installed and well preserved, heaters provide adequate heating power to Redmond, Washington houses.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose spent time troubleshooting the issue, all the while describing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working appropriately. He had to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will definitely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
