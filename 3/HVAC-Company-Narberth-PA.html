<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
