<p>After residing in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the cooling. I went on and purchased this Carrier and I need to say it does the job rather well. It takes very little time to heat up or cool off the house which is one of the important things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had in the past. The system hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
