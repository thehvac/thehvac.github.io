Location control involves moving the toxin source far from residents or even moving prone occupants.<p>
<p>There is no single test to discover an IAQ issue. Your employer ought to inspect measurements of temperature, air and humidity flow. In addition, examination and testing of the ventilation, heating and air conditioning systems (to make certain it is working according to specs for building use and tenancy) ought to be carried out.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not provide auto debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in monthly, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to use car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There need to not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
