<p>These men have actually been terrific. At a realtor, I often require contractors to offer me a viewpoint for what deal with a home might cost. Just recently I required to get in touch with these men two times. They came out quickly and offered me a no nonsense quote for the work. Even when it was news my client probably wouldn't wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I appreciate the honesty. Stability isn't simply their name, its a business design they take seriously. You men are officially on speed dial. Talk with you quickly.<p>
<p>Terrific Item! Delivery was sort of weird being that package was opened and items might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we assured it was all intact. The product was extremely lite weight and requires time to use. Note: buy suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we solved issues. I would recommend this item to anybody who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
