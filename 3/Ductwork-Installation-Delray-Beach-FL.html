Paragon Heating & Home Comfort Solutions DOES NOT use the worthless 'eyeball the flame' approach that other companies use. Rather, the combustion is optimized by measuring the exhaust gasses and making clinical modifications. This alone might pay for the whole maintenance go to at today's cost of natural gas.<p>

The heat exchanger permits air to be warmed without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, providing warm air to private bed rooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
