Allergens found in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can become airborne, and thus, are easily inhaled. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks.

Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your threat of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
