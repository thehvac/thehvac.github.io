Their techs are really educated and professional. Expenses are reasonable. Always on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff set up a brand-new air handler and condenser today. I did not trouble to get rival's quotes due to the fact that of my trust in Waychoff since the cost was obviously affordable.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a tube twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year shut off the electricity open the furnace and extremely carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
