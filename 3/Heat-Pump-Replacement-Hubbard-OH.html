<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Indoor pollutants. These consist of chemicals utilized in the construction or restoration of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances).

Gas cook tops should be utilized with fans that send out exhaust outside.
