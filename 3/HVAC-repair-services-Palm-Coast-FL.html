<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Palm Coast FL</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are incredibly efficient, since ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature level is always at a consistent temperature. These systems can obtain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only attain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Similar to other types of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). POLICE rates just how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling result.

<p>Current Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
