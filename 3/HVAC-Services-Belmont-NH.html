<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
