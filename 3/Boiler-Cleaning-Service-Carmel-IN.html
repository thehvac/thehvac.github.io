A multi-split system 56 is a standard split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and allows cooling or heating of a number of rooms with one external system.

<p>Oil heating units are less common now than natural gas, but they can be helpful in more remote areas where utilities are harder to access, and in cooler climates since it offers more heat per BTU than other options.

<p>When installing over concrete pieces, we recommend using our insulation boards.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
