<p>A packaged system, usually set up on the roof, is most frequently utilized on commercial structures, however it is likewise an option for homeowners to consider. Oftentimes, these units include not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those aiming to save cash on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system separately, because the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are generally just readily available for bigger houses due to their high power and capability.

For that reason, this might not be the very best choice for homeowners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
