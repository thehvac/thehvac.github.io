<p>Indoor pollutants.

In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can add to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops should be used with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating devices should be sealed and power-vented systems set up to get rid of products of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also produce particulates and should be vented outside.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you may want to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump units can have different heating and cooling capacities. If you currently have a home heater, you may try to find a heat pump more geared toward cooling capacity and efficiency. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to search for a design that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winters.

This can lead to the capacity for substantial health problems.<p>
