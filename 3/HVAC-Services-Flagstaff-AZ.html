<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one constraint: their total power should not go beyond the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units greater than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%.

Basically, the outside system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that a few of the spaces might not have a really comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the total power is not easy, given that it considers not just the small power of the systems, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
