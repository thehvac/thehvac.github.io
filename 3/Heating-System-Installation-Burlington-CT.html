<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise changes roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors.
