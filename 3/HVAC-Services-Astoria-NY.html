<p>Considering that the 1980s, manufacturers of HVAC devices have been making an effort to make the systems they make more effective.

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material in time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
