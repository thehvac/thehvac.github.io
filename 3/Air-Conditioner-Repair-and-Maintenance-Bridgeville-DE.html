<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment.

Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils.

It also prevents water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
