<p>A packaged system, usually set up on the roofing, is most frequently used on commercial buildings, however it is also an option for homeowners to think about. Oftentimes, these units contain not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those seeking to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating and cooling system separately, given that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these systems are normally just offered for larger houses due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a good way to save cash on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best choice for property owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
