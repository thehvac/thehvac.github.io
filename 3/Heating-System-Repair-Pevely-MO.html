<p>For each load of laundry you dry, that moisture needs to go someplace. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just asking for mold buildup, states Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a reliable and simple approach to decrease ambient air pollution and potential health dangers, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes give off contaminants.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Residents of homes with poor indoor air quality might complain of signs such as headache, eye irritation, tiredness, dry throat, sinus blockage, nausea, and dizziness. Due to the fact that lots of diseases can trigger these symptoms, identifying sick building syndrome is tough. Incredibly high levels of some pollutants, such as carbon monoxide gas, can cause more serious health problem, including death.<p>
