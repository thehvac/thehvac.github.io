<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more problems, given that some of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling separately for each space. However, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>

Our pointer to any homebuyers: employ Blue Flame to test the air conditioning system before you purchase. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to check AC units even in winter season. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
