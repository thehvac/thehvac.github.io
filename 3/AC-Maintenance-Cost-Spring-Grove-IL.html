<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance in Spring Grove IL</h3>
<p>Geothermal heatpump are exceptionally efficient, since ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature is always at a constant temperature level. These systems can achieve a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just achieve a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Similar to other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). POLICE OFFICER rates how much heat a system produces or gets rid of (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling effect. Most ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this implies is that for every single system of energy utilized by a geothermal heat pump, around 3 to 5 units are supplied back in the kind of heat.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
