<p>Current Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
