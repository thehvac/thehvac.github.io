<p>Indoor contaminants. These consist of chemicals used in the building or restoration of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these appliances (cook stoves, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can add to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops must be utilized with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances should be sealed and power-vented systems set up to remove items of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also develop particulates and must be vented outside.<p>
