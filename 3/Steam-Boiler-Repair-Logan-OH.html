Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
