Indoor air pollution research studies have identified a number of contaminants that can be present in indoor air.

The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion home and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by individuals and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. It can end up being air-borne when it dries.
