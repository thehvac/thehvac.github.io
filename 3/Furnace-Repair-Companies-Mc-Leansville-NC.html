The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

Finally, look for indications of problems with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can suggest your house may not have sufficient ventilation consist of moisture condensation on windows or walls, smelly or stuffy air, unclean central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other products become moldy. To identify smells in your home, action outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether odors are visible.<p>
