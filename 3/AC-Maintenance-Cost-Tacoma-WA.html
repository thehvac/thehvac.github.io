After 2 years, things started to change. There have actually been awkward noises. I got it inspected and fixed. I am hoping that is the end of the concern. Overall, it has actually been a good experience. Trustworthy on the whole. Cool operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its looks in the beginning. However then understood Air conditionings are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix utilized in cars in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this kind of application, however is still imported and can be bought and utilized by licensed HVAC professionals. For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by lots of individuals.<p>
