<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space.

Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage.
