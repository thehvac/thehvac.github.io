<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more challenging to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
