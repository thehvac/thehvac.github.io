<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like extended vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. Many companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to effectively service and the unit has actually been operating problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
