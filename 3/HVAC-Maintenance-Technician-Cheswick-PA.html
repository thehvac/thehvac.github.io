<h3>How Do Air Heat Pump Works at Cheswick PA?</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are extremely effective, since ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature is constantly at a constant temperature level.

Much like other kinds of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). COP rates just how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling impact. Many ground source heat pumps have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this indicates is that for every unit of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, roughly 3 to 5 units are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>
