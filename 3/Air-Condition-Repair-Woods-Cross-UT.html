<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price fantastic however Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

Other helpful referral materials include products from SMACNA, ACGIH, and technical trade journals.<p>

<h3>Electric Heat Pump in Woods Cross UT 84087</h3>
<p>We called Elite A/C on among the hottest days of summer season( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out very same day to assess situation & chose to opt for them for the work. I more than happy to state that not only did we get the central air conditioning going but also changed the heating system which was old. Everyone we talked to from starting to end were very expert, considerate and the work was very efficiently done. I would extremely advise this company.<p>

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for home occupants. Unlike other types of air conditioning unit, evaporative coolers count on the outside air to be transported through cooler pads that cool the air prior to it reaches the within a home through its air duct system; this cooled outside air should be permitted to push the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to keep and understand.<p>
