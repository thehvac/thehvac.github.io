<h3>Home Air Conditioning Company in Wildwood Missouri</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>Terrific Item! Shipment was sort of strange being that package was opened and products could have fell out. But after review of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was extremely lite weight and takes time to use. Keep in mind: purchase advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we dealt with issues. I would suggest this item to anybody who's renovating or installing their restroom for the very first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

For that reason, this may not be the best alternative for homeowners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
