That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed moisture. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In truth, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>
