<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his examination, guaranteeing I comprehended what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
