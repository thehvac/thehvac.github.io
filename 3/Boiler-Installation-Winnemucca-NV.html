<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
