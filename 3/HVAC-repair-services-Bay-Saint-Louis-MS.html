<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not provide car debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money can be found in each month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to provide automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
