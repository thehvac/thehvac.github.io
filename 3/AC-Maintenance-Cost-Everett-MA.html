<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things initially. Make certain all the signs up in your home are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
