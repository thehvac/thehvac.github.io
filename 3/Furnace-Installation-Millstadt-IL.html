Convection is the process of heating air and blowing it about the spaces for the warm air to keep the ceilings, walls and floors heated up. In turn, the items in the room, like furnishings and individuals, would stay warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>

<p>Your Review This is my third time using Around the Clock. Ilan constantly makes himself readily available - whether it's a heating problem in the middle of the night in the depth of winter season to more regular calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is skilled with these devices). I have nothing but fantastic things to say - he has actually taken good care of my heating and AC needs. Quick response - fast resolution.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose spent time repairing the problem, all the while describing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working effectively. He needed to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will definitely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
