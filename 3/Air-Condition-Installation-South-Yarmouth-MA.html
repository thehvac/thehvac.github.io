<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should temporarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
