AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or so.

<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as essential as a routine oil change in your vehicle. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter better traps contaminants and particles in the air. Energy Star suggests replacing your filter when every 3 months. During high usage months, inspect the filters at least regular monthly.<p>

<h3>Install New Air Conditioner in Alexander AR 72002</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
