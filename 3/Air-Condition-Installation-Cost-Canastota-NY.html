Basically, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a method that some of the spaces may not have an extremely comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the overall power is not easy, given that it takes into consideration not just the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
