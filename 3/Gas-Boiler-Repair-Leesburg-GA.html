<h3>Types of HVAC Repairs in Leesburg GA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you may require a recommendation later). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
