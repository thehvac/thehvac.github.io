PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two separate systems (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and permits each space to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adapted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heatpump While space a/c offers optimum versatility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is typically more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>

Convection is the process of heating air and blowing it about the rooms for the warm air to keep the walls, floorings and ceilings heated up.
