<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Our group is led by the 2 Gamst siblings who both began dealing with ac system with their dad John Gamst after school and on weekends. Whether it's maintenance, repair, furnace, or air conditioning installation, neither one keeps in mind discovering the trade it just came naturally.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
