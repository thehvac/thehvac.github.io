<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not offer them.  Second of all like prolonged automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to correctly service and the system has actually been running problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
