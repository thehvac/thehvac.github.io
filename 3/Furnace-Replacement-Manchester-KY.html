<p>There is no easy response, however numerous use the guideline that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is probably a better service.

<p>The predominant health effect related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your threat of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
