<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
