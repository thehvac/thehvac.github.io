<p>Inspect these three things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in your home are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). The decreased air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
