<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might want to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump units can have different heating and cooling capabilities. You may look for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capability and performance if you already have a house heating system. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to try to find a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The bright side is that the one significant downside of heat pumps is that they can fail in the exceptionally hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
