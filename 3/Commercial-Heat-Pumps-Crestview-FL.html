<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite considerable.<p>
