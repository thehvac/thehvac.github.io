<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall.

Because they don't need any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Since an unit is installed in each room or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature in the room when you exist.<p>

<p>The primary health impact related to exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may present risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
