<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his employees, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't sound like much, particularly if the objective of owning a company was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it took to construct business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't completion objective.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money can be found in each month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to use car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
