Today's heating systems are ranked 90% efficiency or better; it is not uncommon for a modern-day furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older designs, which might be rated as low as 80% efficiency, this can indicate significant savings in yearly heating expenses. Modern 2- and three-stage heating systems increase effectiveness even further by performing at lower or higher capability depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>The life-span of a central air system is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's a/c are more energy efficient than models made even 5 years earlier, so it makes monetary sense to change or upgrade your system if it's 5 years old or older. The best central air conditioning conditioner you can buy today will utilize 30-50% less energy than one purchased in 1975 while providing the very same amount of cooling.<p>
