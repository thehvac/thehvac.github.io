<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Sean was extremely helpful. He is a very pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure applied to buy additional things. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no problems aside from the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
