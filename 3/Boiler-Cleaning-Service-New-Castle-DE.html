<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol impact, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from improperly put or kept evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which might enter nearby ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside water fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is extremely under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
