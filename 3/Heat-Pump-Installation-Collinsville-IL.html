<p>PE firms tend to operate with the objective of selling or spinning off a company at some point. This could be through a public offering, a sale to a big company in the field, or even a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for a/c repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you need to examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
