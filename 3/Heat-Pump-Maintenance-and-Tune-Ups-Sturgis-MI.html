<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product gradually. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
