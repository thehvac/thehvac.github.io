<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price fantastic however Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
