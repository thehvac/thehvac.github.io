<h3>Ductless AC System in Compton CA 90221</h3>
<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most budget-friendly if your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape. Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
