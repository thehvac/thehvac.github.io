<p>The probability of instant responses to indoor air contaminants depends upon numerous factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important influences. In other cases, whether an individual reacts to a contaminant depends on individual level of sensitivity, which varies tremendously from person to person. Some people can become sensitized to biological contaminants after repeated exposures, and it appears that some people can become sensitized to chemical contaminants as well.<p>

People also react really differently to direct exposure to indoor air pollutants. More research is needed to better understand which health impacts occur after exposure to the average toxin concentrations found in houses and which occur from the greater concentrations that take place for short amount of times.<p>
