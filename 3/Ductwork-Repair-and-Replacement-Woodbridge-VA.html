<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical material in time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
