<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
