<h3>Typical HVAC Services Offered by a Osprey FL HVAC Company</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even little window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or washed as conditions necessitate. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will require to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
