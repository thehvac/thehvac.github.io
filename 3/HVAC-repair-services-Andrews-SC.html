<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
