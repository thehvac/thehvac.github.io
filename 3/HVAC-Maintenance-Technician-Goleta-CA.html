<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
