<p>Chemical toxins: Volatile natural substances ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are many, varied, and common. They consist of both human-made and naturally taking place chemical compounds. Chemical toxins can include tobacco smoke, emissions from items used in the building (e.g., workplace equipment; furniture, wall and flooring coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer items) unintentional spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>The possibility of immediate responses to indoor air toxins depends on numerous factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important influences. In other cases, whether a person responds to a toxin depends upon specific level of sensitivity, which differs enormously from person to person. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological toxins after repeated exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical pollutants too.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ might notice undesirable or moldy smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are worsening, talk with your physician about them. However not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for excellent structure management.<p>
