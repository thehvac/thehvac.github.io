These various heat sources also determine the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer utilizing an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat utilizing a closed loop.<p>

<p>Lead has long been recognized as a hazardous environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " top ecological risk to the health of children in the United States." There are many methods which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead gets in the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Prior to it was understood how damaging lead might be, it was utilized in paint, fuel, water pipes, and numerous other items.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended period of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide need to be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements used for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors may likewise be required.<p>
