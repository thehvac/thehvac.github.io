<h3>Signs You Might Need an AC Repair Service in Sun Valley CA</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even small window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or washed as conditions require. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. In addition, really dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that an ac system moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both need to be kept tidy. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise essential to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
