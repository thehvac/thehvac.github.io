<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c unit back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, location 2 2x4s underneath package to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>
<p>Truth: Federal and local incentives normally amount to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can often make the initial cost of a system competitive with standard equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, throughout new construction (houses normally utilize in between one and 5 heaps). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap. However, brand-new installation practices are reducing costs, to the point where the price is getting closer to traditional systems under the right conditions.<p>
