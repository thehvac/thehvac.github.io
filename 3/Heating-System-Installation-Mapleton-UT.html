<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Due to the fact that it tires warm air out the top, don't put the condenser under a deck or totally enclose it. Any air flow limitation will decrease the unit's efficiency. You can, nevertheless, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily circulate around it.<p>
<p>. Prior to selecting the installation location of air conditioning unit, numerous primary aspects need to be considered. Firstly, the direction of air flow from the indoor systems must not fall on the place of rest or workspace.
