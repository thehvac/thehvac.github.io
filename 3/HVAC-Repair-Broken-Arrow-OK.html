<p>An indoor air contaminant is a substance in the air that might affect the health of individuals who live in the house. Pollutants could originate from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon entering your house from the ground below. An air contaminant could likewise originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or personal care items. Germs and infections, pet dander, and insect parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
