<p>There are a couple of possibilities to explain short cycling in really winter. The most obvious is the possibility of the high demands placed on the system due to the really low temperature levels. Often, the furnace will just run harder to preserve a warm environment for your house when the weather is extremely cold. There are other possibilities such as a crack in the heat exchanger or a broken thermostat. If you need clarity on this issue, contact one of our service technicians.<p>
