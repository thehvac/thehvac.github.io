PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioner into a heat pump While room a/c provides optimum versatility, when utilized to cool lots of rooms at a time it is typically more pricey than central air.<p>
