<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heating systems are still extensively used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>The life-span of a central air unit is thought about to be 15-20 years, and today's ac system are more energy efficient than designs made 5 years ago, so it makes financial sense to change or update your unit if it's five years old or older. The best central air conditioning conditioner you can purchase today will use 30-50% less energy than one acquired in 1975 while providing the very same amount of cooling.<p>
