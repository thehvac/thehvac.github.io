<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for a/c repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
