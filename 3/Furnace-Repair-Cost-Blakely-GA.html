<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
