<p>How climate modification affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants.

As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The ac system's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
