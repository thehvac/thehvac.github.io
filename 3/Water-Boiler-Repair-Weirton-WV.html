<p>Professional heating unit setups. However, even the best-maintained heater will eventually stop working. HVAC specialists recommend following this fundamental rule when deciding whether it deserves purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a new system, it's finest to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than required.<p>
