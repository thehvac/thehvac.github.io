<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not offer auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash can be found in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to use car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
