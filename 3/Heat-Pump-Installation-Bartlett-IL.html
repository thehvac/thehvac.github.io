<p>Due to the fact that it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your house by means of ducts, and cool air is gathered through cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s may be ranked 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion procedure. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%.
