<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Companies in Sterling</h2>

<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price fantastic however Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Sterling IL?</h3>
<p>Geothermal heatpump are very efficient, since ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature is constantly at a consistent temperature level. These systems can obtain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only attain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Much like other types of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance ranked according to their coefficient of performance (COP). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system produces or removes (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling impact. Most ground source heatpump have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for every unit of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, roughly 3 to 5 units are provided back in the form of heat.<p>
