<p>Similar to a lot of house improvement projects, the cost of a complete central heating unit can differ extensively based upon the size of the home. The majority of heaters will last in between 15 and 20 years. In choosing a furnace, property owners need to consider heat output and efficiency. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the home. A small home, for instance, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the house too rapidly and turn off for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature levels.<p>

<h3>Electric Heating Systems in Rocky Hill CT 06067</h3>
<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
