<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average house. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, but it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
