<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this.
