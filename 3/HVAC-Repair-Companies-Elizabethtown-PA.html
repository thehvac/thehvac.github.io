<h3>Energy Efficient Heaters in Elizabethtown PA 17022</h3>
<p>The federal government recommends that homes be weatherized in order to reduce the amount of energy needed for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, steps should also be taken to minimize contamination from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for suggested actions.) In addition, citizens should be alert to the development of indications of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew growth. Additional weatherization steps must not be carried out until these problems have actually been corrected.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance items that just a qualified HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, but a property owner does not have the tools or abilities essential to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and correct air flow are important to a well-functioning system, however house owners lack the necessary devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still required to have a professional technician examine the system periodically.<p>

<p>Ventilation plays an essential role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of processes which results in the supply and removal of air from inside a structure." Those procedures consist of bringing in outdoors air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the structure, and moving some part of indoor air outside. If one or more of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
