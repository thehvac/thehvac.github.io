The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing.

<p>The cost for heatpump installation likewise depends upon the size of the unit and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, including installation. Whole-house units, on the other hand, range in cost from $2,500 to $7,500, consisting of installation. Geothermal heat pumps typically require excavation to install, which adds several thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must momentarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
