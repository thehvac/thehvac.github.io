<p>How environment change affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit increase. This increase has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c should increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
