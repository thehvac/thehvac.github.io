(If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
