<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
