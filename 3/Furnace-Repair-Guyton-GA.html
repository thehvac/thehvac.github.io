<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
