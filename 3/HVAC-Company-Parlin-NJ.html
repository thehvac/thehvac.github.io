<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the a/c back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging material to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, place 2 2x4s beneath the box to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the very same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes.

You get instant, real-time access to the monitoring results via a dashboard, which turns the information into visual charts that are easy to figure out.<p>
