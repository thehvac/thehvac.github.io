A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure.

<p>A packaged system, normally set up on the roof, is most frequently used on commercial structures, but it is likewise an alternative for homeowners to think about. Many times, these units contain not just the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those seeking to save cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system independently, considering that the system is combined. However, one con is that these systems are generally just offered for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a good way to save money on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than buying just a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the best option for homeowners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
