<p>The likelihood of immediate responses to indoor air toxins depends upon several aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 important impacts. In other cases, whether an individual responds to a contaminant depends on individual level of sensitivity, which varies significantly from individual to person. Some people can become sensitized to biological pollutants after repeated direct exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical contaminants too.<p>
<p>If your single phase ac system isn't old sufficient to justify replacement, think about an entire house dehumidifier. By installing dehumidification devices inside an existing single phase system, you can take pleasure in some of the advantages of a variable speed compressor without replacing any devices. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfortable level, enhancing indoor air quality and enabling greater comfort at higher temperature levels.<p>
<p>After the system has been looked for leakages, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside should be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
