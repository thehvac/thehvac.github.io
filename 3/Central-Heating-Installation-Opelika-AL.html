<p>4 Seasons has set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have found them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was necessary and redid the entire plenum and the duct work for the water heater due to the fact that the service technicians thought they just didn't appear ideal and they couldn't leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should momentarily change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
