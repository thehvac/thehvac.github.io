<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance at Sidney OH</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
