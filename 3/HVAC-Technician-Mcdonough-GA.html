<h3>Three Essential Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Mcdonough GA</h3>
<p>You are a covidiot if you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else might come other than for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they needed to buy it. My better half said that she had actually seen a terrific review for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow.
