<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is taken in from indoors and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for residence occupants. Unlike other kinds of a/c unit, evaporative coolers rely on the outdoors air to be funnelled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the within a home through its air duct system; this cooled outside air should be enabled to press the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically basic to preserve and comprehend.<p>
