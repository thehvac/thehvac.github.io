<p>For example, issues develop when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not used to bring in adequate amounts of outside air.

Poorly located outside air intake vents can also bring in air infected with auto and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological impurities that have actually increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, ac system, or the within surfaces of ventilation duct work.<p>
