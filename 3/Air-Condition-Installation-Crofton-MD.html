<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not offer auto debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in monthly, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to offer car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract..
