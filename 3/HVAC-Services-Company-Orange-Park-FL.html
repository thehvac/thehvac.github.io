<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it extremely quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
