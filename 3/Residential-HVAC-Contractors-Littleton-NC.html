<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that might impact the health of individuals who reside in the house. Pollutants could come from outside the house-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon entering the house from the ground below. An air toxin might also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or personal care items. Germs and viruses, pet dander, and pest parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>A 3rd method to choose whether your house might have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, look for indications of issues with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can show your home might not have enough ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or stinky air, filthy central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other items become moldy. To find smells in your house, step outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether smells are noticeable.<p>
