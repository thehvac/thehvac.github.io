A few high-end brands have a performance of 95% by using a condenser. These are more expensive, having beginning costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. Because a drain needs to be installed, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>
<p>Mobile homes are generally smaller than stick-built homes and use considerably less oil and a much smaller sized furnace to heat. Expect the typical mobile house oil furnace to have beginning costs of around $1,500.

<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have concerns, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Bought a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
