When they laid a network of pipes under their marble floors and connected them into a hot water supply, radiant heat systems have actually been around given that the days of the Romans. Romans utilized a wood-fired boiler tended by slaves and an elementary pumping device to flow warm water that warmed their stone floors. In turn, the uniformity of the floor heat transferred heat to other posts in the spaces, including the human occupants.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area.
