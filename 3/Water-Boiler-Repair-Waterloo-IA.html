<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioner back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packing material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s beneath the box to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat increases, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the flooring level.

Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off.<p>
