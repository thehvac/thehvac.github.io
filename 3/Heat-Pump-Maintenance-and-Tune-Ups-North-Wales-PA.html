<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 ought to be calibrated frequently, and outside measurements utilized for calculations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may also be required.<p>
