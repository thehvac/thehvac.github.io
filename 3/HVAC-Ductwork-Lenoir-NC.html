<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor units has one limitation: their overall power should not exceed the capability of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor systems greater than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to expect better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the same time, since the total capability of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outside unit. Basically, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms may not have a really comfy temperature level. However, the estimation of the overall power is not simple, since it considers not just the small power of the units, however also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

(He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>
