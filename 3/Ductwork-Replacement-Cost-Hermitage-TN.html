<h3>What Are Inverted Heat Pumps in Hermitage TN?</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outdoor  system instead of ducting air straight from the outside unit. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your a/c and heat pump must be without all obstructions and particles. Obstructions can block the flow of condensed water and cause wetness accumulation within the system.

An expert maintenance technician will clean up the condensate and flush drain to guarantee all excess moisture streams far from the system.<p>
