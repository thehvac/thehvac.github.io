<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, carried out a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
