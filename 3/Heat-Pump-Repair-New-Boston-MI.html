For example, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to expensive compressor failure, but a house owner does not have the tools or skills required to check refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and correct air flow are vital to a well-functioning system, but property owners do not have the needed devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still necessary to have an expert technician check the system occasionally.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you need to inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
