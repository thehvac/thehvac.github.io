Normally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay.

<p>When installing a wall sensor, consider the height at which they need to be positioned. Many typically they are mounted at height-level or somewhat lower, if individuals mainly remain seated in that particular location. However, the molecular weight of some compounds makes them gravitate towards the floor or ceiling; depending on what toxin you're trying to track you'll need to put the sensor accordingly. For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the highest concentrations inside structures are usually near the ceiling. On the other hand, ozone is heavier than air and stays near the floor.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
