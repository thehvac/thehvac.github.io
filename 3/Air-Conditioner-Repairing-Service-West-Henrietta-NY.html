The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>When all the jobs have actually been completed, the last job is to evaluate the system to make sure it cools effectively. HVAC systems are run through the thermostat. This last check may mention faults in the thermostat, which might be as easy as a need to replace batteries. A failure to switch on may just include a tripped circuit breaker. At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician talks about any problems or issues and makes recommendations about upgrades where proper.<p>
