<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his employees, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the objective of owning a service was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it took to construct the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't the end goal. HVAC entrepreneur must strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the same in all other locations.<p>
