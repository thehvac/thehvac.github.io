<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
