<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the check out. They suggested replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a quick internet search validated WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was very happy they stood by their work and fixed the issue. Will certainly be using them once again.<p>

<p>Numerous people are becoming more worried and conscious about their health and the impact of indoor air quality.

<p>As much of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment manufacturer's to guarantee your factory warranties remain in location. In addition, the tangible outcomes of a PM is typically hard to measure, as one response specified the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioning system do not simply break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the result of recurring use of a part that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing premature deterioration, resulting in holes and cracks. , if that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and protects the part.. a very advantageous result and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
