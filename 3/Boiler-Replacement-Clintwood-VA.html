<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold.

To compensate for this, the heat pump system should briefly switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
