<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
