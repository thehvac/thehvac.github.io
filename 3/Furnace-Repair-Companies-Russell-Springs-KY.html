<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you should check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis.

This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
