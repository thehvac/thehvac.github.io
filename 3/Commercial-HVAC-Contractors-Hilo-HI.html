<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to run due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a properly sized system. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate since it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off prior to it has an opportunity to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the required moisture. The result is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature shows. In truth, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
