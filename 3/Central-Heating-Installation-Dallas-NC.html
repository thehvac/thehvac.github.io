<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
