Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
