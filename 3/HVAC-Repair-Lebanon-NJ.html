<p>Indoor contaminants. These include chemicals utilized in the construction or restoration of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these appliances (cook ranges, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops need to be utilized with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating devices should be sealed and power-vented systems set up to get rid of items of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also develop particulates and need to be vented outside.<p>
<p>Normally the most effective way to improve indoor air quality is to remove individual sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to reduce the amount of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more cost-efficient approach to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your home are noted later on in this section.<p>
