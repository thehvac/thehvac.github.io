<p>The predominant health effect associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your risk of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
