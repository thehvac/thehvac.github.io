In turn, the things in the space, like furnishings and people, would stay warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
