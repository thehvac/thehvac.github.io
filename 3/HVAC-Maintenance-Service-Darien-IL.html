<p>Proper ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same pollutants. To put it simply, in some cases the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>Air conditioner makers usually make rugged, high quality products. If your a/c unit fails, start by checking any fuses or breaker.
