<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices generally lasts years, given that it is secured indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical guidelines eliminate the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground in time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off toxins.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating enough outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
