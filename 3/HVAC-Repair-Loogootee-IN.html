<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
