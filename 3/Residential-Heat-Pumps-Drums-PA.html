<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
