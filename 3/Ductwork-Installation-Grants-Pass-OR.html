<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
