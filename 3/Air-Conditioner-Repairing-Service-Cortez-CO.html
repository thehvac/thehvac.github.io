<p>While radon in water is not a problem in houses served by the majority of public water materials, it has been found in well water. If you've tested the air in your house and discovered a radon issue, and you have a well, call a laboratory accredited to determine radiation in water to have your water evaluated. Radon issues in water can be easily repaired. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more details.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is taken in from indoors and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of brand-new houses are beginning to include mechanical systems that bring outside air into the home.
