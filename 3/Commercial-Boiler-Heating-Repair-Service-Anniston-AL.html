<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do not accept them until they have been properly dried. Attempt a various dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>

While a space heater remains in use, open a door from the room where the heating system lies to the remainder of the home and open a window somewhat.<p>
