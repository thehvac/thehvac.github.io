<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a reference in the future).

The female crimp adapters need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
