<p>Place the solar storage tank near the conventional water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the tank, ensure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are accessible. If the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank, it is likely that it is supported by the plumbing. Set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not need to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced.<p>

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most heating systems have multiple control boards. The biggest, or just one in some heaters, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the brand-new control panel need to be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the concern isnâ $ t properly identified, altering a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable once installed. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a pro to identify.<p>
