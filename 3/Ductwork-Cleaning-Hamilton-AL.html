<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes.
