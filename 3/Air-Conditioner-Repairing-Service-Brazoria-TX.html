<p>The primary factor homeowners do not buy an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 each year, depending on the quantity of services offered. If the system is new and still under a maker's service warranty, the cost may not be worthwhile. Any significant repairs need to be covered under the maker's guarantee.

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you should examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
