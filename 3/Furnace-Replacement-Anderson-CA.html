<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ may discover undesirable or musty odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no replacement for great building management.<p>
