<p>AC units and thermostats have built-in hold-up functions when they're closed down and then repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't use this measurement much any longer.<p>
