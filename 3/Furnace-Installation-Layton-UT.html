<p>Though it might be difficult to think, the air inside your house can be worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are well-known for decreasing the air quality in your home, however there are many other toxins that can not only dirty up the air, but result in other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and building materials contribute to bad air quality, and can also cause cancers. VOCs (unstable organic compounds) from paint and even from some kinds of carpets and upholstery products can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be offenders, too.<p>

You may look for a heat pump more tailored toward cooling capacity and effectiveness if you already have a home heating system.
