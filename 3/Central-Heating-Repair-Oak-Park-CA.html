<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be rather significant.<p>

<h3>HVAC Service Technician in Oak Park California</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the visit. They suggested replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap however a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was extremely delighted they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will definitely be utilizing them once again.<p>
