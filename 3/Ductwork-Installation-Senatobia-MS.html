<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you should check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
