<h3>Furnace Repair in Hayden AL 35079</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>There are a couple of possibilities to discuss short biking in really cold weather. The most obvious is the possibility of the high demands placed on the system due to the very low temperatures. In some cases, the furnace will merely run more difficult to maintain a warm environment for your house when the weather is extremely cold. There are other possibilities such as a crack in the heat exchanger or a damaged thermostat. If you need clarity on this concern, contact one of our specialists.<p>
