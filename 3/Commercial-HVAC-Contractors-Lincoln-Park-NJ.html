<h3>Geothermal Heating And Cooling in Lincoln Park NJ 07035</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
