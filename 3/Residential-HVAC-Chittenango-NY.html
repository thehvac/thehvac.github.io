<p>I am changing our High Velocity System since of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted devices, a Provider, Convenience Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high velocity supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an alternative for an additional $2,818.00 to set up a Carrier Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
