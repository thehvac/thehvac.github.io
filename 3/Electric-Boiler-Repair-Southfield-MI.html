<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. A ducted heat pump system might be most affordable if your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are susceptible to cold areas", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and really hot beside the radiators. This normally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your home escape out of the window. Convected heat provides warmth from the floor up throughout the space without any cold areas or stuffiness in the area being warmed.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the huge photo" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality monitor can be set up to provide threshold notifies.

From there you can take the appropriate action to solve the scenario immediately.<p>
