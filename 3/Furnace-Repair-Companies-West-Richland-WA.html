<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for a/c repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you must inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
