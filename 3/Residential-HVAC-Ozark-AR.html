When the copper or aluminum coils begin to rust, refrigerant leaks happen.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you ought to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis.

If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
