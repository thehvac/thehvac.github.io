<p>When our furnace was passing away, we called two local companies for quotes. While both were helpful and useful, Ballard Gas provided us a much better offer, for remarkable service. Rather than a simple sales job, the owner of the company made a full evaluation of our heating unit and located ways we could have more even heat. He consisted of these significant however minor adjustments in his bid.

<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
