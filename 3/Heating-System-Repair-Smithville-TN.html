<p>Since an ac system moves heat between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both need to be kept clean. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
