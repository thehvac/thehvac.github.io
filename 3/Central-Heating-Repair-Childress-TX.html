<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
