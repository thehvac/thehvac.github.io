Too big and you'll run into issues with short-cycling, which can harm the air conditioning unit and reduce its life. Too small and your air conditioning unit won't be able to cool the house effectively. When shopping for a new AC system, these are simply a few of the factors that you need to take into account.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you should inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
