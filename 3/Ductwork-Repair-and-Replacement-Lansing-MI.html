A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate since it merely takes more electrical power to run a larger system. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed wetness. The outcome is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature level indicates. In reality, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
