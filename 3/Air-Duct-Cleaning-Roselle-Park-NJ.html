This minimizes the interior system footprint and enables each room to be changed independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heatpump While space cooling provides optimum versatility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is usually more pricey than central air.<p>
