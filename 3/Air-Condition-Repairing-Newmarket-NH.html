<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very helpful in collecting information on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to temporarily cope with the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and provided clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began.
