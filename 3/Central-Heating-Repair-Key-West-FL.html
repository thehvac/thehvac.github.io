<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as vital as a regular oil modification in your car. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear.

During high usage months, check the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
