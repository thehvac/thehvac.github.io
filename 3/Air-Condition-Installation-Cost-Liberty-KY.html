<h3>Designing Tips to Central Heating Systems at Liberty KY</h3>
<p>Sean was very helpful. He is a very enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure used to buy additional stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. The only factor he might not install the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood just what the problem was and repaired it very quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
