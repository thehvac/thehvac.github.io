<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, class or laboratory environments, instead of outside or commercial settings. In tasks where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the building. It might likewise consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to specific spaces.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job finding the outdoor system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
