Nevertheless, many of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
