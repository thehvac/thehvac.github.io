<p>A third way to decide whether your home may have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, search for indications of issues with the ventilation in your house. Indications that can suggest your house may not have adequate ventilation include wetness condensation on windows or walls, stuffy or smelly air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other items become musty. To discover odors in your house, action outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your house, note whether odors are obvious.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you must inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
