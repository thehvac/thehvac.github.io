<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace professionals often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on.

Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan.

This makes geothermal heating a trusted and offered source of energy.<p>
