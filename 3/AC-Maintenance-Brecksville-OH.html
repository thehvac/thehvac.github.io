<p>A specialized a/c unit that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioning unit in that both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the same air path. A basic ac system transfers heat out of the room since its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, considering that all components of the dehumidifier remain in the very same room, no heat is eliminated. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is actually warmed, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
