OSHA, NIOSH and others have set NO2 standards, and the World Health Company (WHO) has set standards for both-- including for indoor air.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into homes through dirt floorings, cracks in concrete walls and floorings, flooring drains, and sumps.

This kind of air conditioning unit also is used in little commercial buildings. Air supply and return ducts originate from inside through the house's exterior wall or roof to get in touch with the packaged air conditioning unit, which is typically situated outdoors.

The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air helps and dilutes indoor contaminants exhaust them from the home.<p>

For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by numerous people.<p>
