<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't use them.  Second of all like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have.
