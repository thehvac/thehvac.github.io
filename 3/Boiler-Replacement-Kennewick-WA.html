<h3>HVAC Repair in Kennewick WA 99336</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
