<p>Instantaneous discount rates on high-efficiency heat pump innovations are available to devices installers, used at the wholesaler or supplier point-of-purchase. Outstanding Customer Care! Climate Pro is reliable and really appreciated us and our scenario. We came home one night to a cold house. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came by that very same night. Although he didn't have the required replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he could look for and purchase it the next early morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was definitely appreciative to have a heated home once again. What's most fantastic was that this all occurred throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover someone to help us right before a holiday, however Environment Pro came through for us. I will happily suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outdoor unit as near to your home as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
