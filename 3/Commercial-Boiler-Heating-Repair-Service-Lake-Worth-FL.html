<p>Today, millions of allergen, dead skin cells, building particles, and mold may be residing in your home's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe in addition to the effectiveness of your heating and cooling system. There are a number of style techniques in usage today; however, all ground source heat pumps operate with comparable concepts. Every one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface units and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These various heat sources also dictate the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer utilizing an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up routinely, they can become blocked with debris that can restrict airflow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's effectiveness.
