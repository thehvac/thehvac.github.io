<p>The compressor can overheat and shut down if the condenser coils are obstructed. You'll experience periodic periods of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them again. Shut off the power. Turn the cooling service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the detach block (Picture 1) and clean the condenser coils (Image 2).

Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outdoors air.<p>
