I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance.

After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
