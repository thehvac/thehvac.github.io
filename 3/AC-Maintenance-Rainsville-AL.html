<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil.
