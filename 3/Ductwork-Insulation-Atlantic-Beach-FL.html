<p>Prior to setting up any brand-new heating or cooling system in a home, it is required to re examine and reduce the energy load of the house. A more energy efficient home will not only decrease the cost of a new system and energy expenses, but it will significantly improve the comfort of your home. Before we style and set up any systems, we arrange a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will advise improvements and make estimates for cost and energy cost savings from these improvements. Basic improvements typically include adding insulation and air sealing measures.
