<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roofing, is most commonly used on commercial structures, however it is also a choice for homeowners to consider. Often times, these systems contain not just the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged units are great for those looking to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system individually, since the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these units are usually only offered for larger homes due to their high power and capacity.
