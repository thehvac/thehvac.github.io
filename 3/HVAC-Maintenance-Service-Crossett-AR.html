<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to install a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
