HVAC specialists recommend following this basic guideline when choosing whether it's worth buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a brand-new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than needed.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners are more efficient than space a/c. In addition, they are out of the way, quiet, and convenient to operate.

Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER.
