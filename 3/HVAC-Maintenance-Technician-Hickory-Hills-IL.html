<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everyone can afford, a lot of Seattleites should find ways to combat the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in big box stores like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring screens.
