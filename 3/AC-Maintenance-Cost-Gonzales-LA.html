<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outdoor system as near to your home as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Variable speed is the way to go if it's time to update an aging AC. Already planning to replace an existing ac system? Presuming your budget plan accommodates a variable speed unit, you should definitely get one! You'll feel more comfy throughout the summertime, and your indoor air will be great deal cleaner. At least, think about a two stage compressor for improved comfort and performance.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide ought to be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off toxins.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the concept of an in-floor heater seems less like a high-end product and more like a necessity. (Besides, heated up floors were great enough for the Roman Empire) However before you dedicate to what can be a major remodeling job, it's best to ask yourself whether a radiant floor heater is a proper solution for your particular home heating requirements.<p>
