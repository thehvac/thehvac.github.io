<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
