Due to the fact that they only partly remove the radon decay products and do not reduce the quantity of radon going into the home, the efficiency of these gadgets is unpredictable.

EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, supplies additional info on air-cleaning gadgets to decrease indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices usually lasts years, since it is secured indoors. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical standards get rid of the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat in time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
