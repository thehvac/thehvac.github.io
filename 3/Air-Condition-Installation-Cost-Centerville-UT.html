<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
