This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

<h3>Signs It's Time to Replace Your Boiler in Tempe AZ</h3>
<p>A hydronic glowing floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipelines installed under the floor or right within the flooring surface itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the floor mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other posts with strong mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and people. It does not rely on heating or moving air to transfer warmth.<p>
