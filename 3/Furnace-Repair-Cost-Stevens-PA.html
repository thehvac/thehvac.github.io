Due to the fact that it just takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit, a large-scale compressor also costs more to operate. And an oversize system does not lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a possibility to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness. The outcome is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In truth, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
