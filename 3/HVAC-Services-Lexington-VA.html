<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They provide me top priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
