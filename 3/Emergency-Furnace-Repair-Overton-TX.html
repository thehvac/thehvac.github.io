<p>When our furnace was passing away, we contacted 2 local companies for quotes. While both were useful and valuable, Ballard Natural Gas offered us a better deal, for exceptional service. Rather than a simple sales task, the owner of the company made a complete assessment of our heating unit and located ways we might have more even heat.
