<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heaters are still widely used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC refrigerators unlawful. 30 DuPont and other companies obstructed the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the method as "that German technology". 29 31 Nevertheless, in 2004, Greenpeace dealt with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later on Pepsico and others, to create a corporate coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, 4 years later on, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric started to take actions to support production and usage in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA decided in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-134a, r-404a and r-410a are, as of 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and air conditioning, R-1234yf in vehicles, R-32 in residential air conditioning and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration. R-600 (isobutane) is already widely used in residential refrigeration.<p>
