<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets requests for assessment and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. However, much of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems are less typical now than natural gas, however they can be useful in more remote regions where utilities are more difficult to gain access to, and in cooler climates due to the fact that it offers more heat per BTU than other options. The installation cost will be lower, but energy expenses will be higher, as much as three times higher than gas or electric furnaces. They need a storage tank on the immediate property and more maintenance. In general, they cost in between $2,000 and $8,000 to set up. Overall, they offer an AFUE score of between 80 and 90 percent.<p>

Carpets will straight insulate the floor from the space, reducing performance, so if you want to set up carpet in a radiant-heated space, use a thin carpet with thick cushioning.<p>
<p>A geothermal heater is more reliable than alternatives, and is not affected by any external factors, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar energy. For instance, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar power relies on routine sunshine to work effectively. Geothermal heating depends on neither the wind nor the sun, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a readily available and dependable  source of energy.<p>
