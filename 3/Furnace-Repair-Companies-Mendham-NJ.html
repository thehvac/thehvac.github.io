<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Right now, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, building debris, and mold may be living in your house's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe as well as the performance of your heating and cooling system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a recent survey by the Consumer Reports National Research Center. But many of the important things individuals do-- or don't do-- can add to the stew of airborne pollutants in their houses and aggravate asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. For that reason, an expert service person need to be required almost any maintenance aside from regular cleaning. Central air conditioning conditioners need to be professionally checked and changed prior to the start of every cooling season. Nevertheless, don't let your maintenance end with this yearly checkup.
