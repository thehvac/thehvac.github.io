<h3>Natural Gas Furnace Service in Canton NC 28716</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer breakdowns. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that secure your air conditioning system from flooding. Among the most typical locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a good chance; you may have a water leak in the attic. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This deactivates all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is likewise a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on uncommon celebrations.<p>
