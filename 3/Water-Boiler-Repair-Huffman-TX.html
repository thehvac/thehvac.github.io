<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my organisations, my own houses and my property customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. When I called and he encouraged me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again, he assisted me trouble shoot the issue. He is truthful, trusted, and sensible on rate. It's hard to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
