<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as an Essential Organisation in Los Angeles.

<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system develops more troubles, since a few of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the a/c separately for each space. However, now the marketplace has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>

Place control includes moving the toxin source away from residents and even transferring prone residents.<p>

For instance, residential HVAC installation need to be priced differently from commercial HVAC installation, and an HVAC service should be priced in a different way from duct cleaning.
