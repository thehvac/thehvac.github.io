<p>I usually don't leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
