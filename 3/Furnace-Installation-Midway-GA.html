<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden flooring joist system, below the wooded subsurface and last floor finish. This is generally used in a second or third-floor  location and takes advantage of the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional density of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber radiant flooring heat hydronic system effective, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipes to direct heat up.<p>
<p>Many elements affect IAQ. These elements include bad ventilation (lack of outside air), issues controlling temperature, high or low humidity, recent renovation, and other activities in or near a structure that can impact the fresh air entering into the structure. In some cases, specific impurities like dust from construction or restoration, mold, cleaning materials, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (including percentages of chemicals released as a gas gradually) may trigger poor IAQ.<p>
