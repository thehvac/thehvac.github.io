<p>Appropriate ventilation assists enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the same contaminants.

<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as just glowing systems.

When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the technique is described as radiant heating.<p>
