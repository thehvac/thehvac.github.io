<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical product in time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
