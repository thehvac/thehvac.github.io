<h3>Duct Cleaning On Your Escanaba MI Home</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even little window bundle units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be changed or washed as conditions warrant. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Furthermore, really filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
