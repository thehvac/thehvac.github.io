<p>Cooling can also be offered by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its efficiency.<p>
