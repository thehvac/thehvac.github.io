<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a big central air conditioner system that sits outdoors your house. Heatpump run on electrical energy and work like air conditioners in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>In a location where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great main heating systems. You'll want to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperature levels reach freezing.

<p>A geothermal heating unit is more trusted than options, and is not affected by any external aspects, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar power. For example, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar power counts on regular sunlight to work effectively.

This makes geothermal heating a trusted and readily available source of energy.<p>
