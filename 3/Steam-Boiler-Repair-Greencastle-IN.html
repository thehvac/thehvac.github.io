Packaged units are fantastic for those aiming to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system independently, considering that the system is integrated. However, one con is that these units are typically just offered for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the very best alternative for homeowners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
