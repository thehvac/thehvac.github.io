<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning systems are determined in loads. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your home. For example, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it indicates the quantity of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>EER stands for Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning units is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 Â° F and an indoor temperature of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Numerous AC systems feature a variety of unique features that can further improve efficiency and effectiveness. For example, property owners may wish to try to find one that includes an integrated filter light that will inform you when the air filter needs to be altered. Another popular function to try to find is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on at night to lower energy expenses even more. Naturally, more features imply greater central air conditioning costs.<p>
