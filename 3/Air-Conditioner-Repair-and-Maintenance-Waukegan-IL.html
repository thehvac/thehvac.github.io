<p>Acknowledged as a leader in the HVAC market, Bard Production integrates quality products and exceptional service with innovation and technological advances to provide high-performance heating & cooling items around the globe. A multi-split system 56 is a standard split system, which is divided into 2 parts (evaporator and condenser) and permits cooling or heating of a number of rooms with one external unit. In the outdoor system of this air conditioning unit there is a more powerful compressor, ports for connecting numerous traces and automation with locking valves for managing the volume of refrigerant supplied to the indoor systems found in the room.<p>
<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more difficulties, considering that some of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each space. However, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
