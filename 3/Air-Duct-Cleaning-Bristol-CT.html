<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential buildings has actually become an important problem to homeowners and health experts. Indoor air pollution research studies have recognized numerous impurities that can be present in indoor air.

Proper ventilation and removal of the sources of these contaminants are important in keeping great indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Occupational direct exposure limitations utilize dose-response data which reveal the health impacts of repeated exposure to one specific chemical. Similar data is not offered for long-term, low-level direct exposures to a mix of contaminants as is the case for IAQ problems. Currently, there is inadequate details readily available to anticipate the results of direct exposure to a number of potentially harmful agents at the exact same time.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the visit. They advised changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap however a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the go to or the new part. I was extremely delighted they stood by their work and fixed the issue. Will certainly be using them once again.<p>

Presently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) requirements however it does provide standards about the most typical IAQ office complaints.<p>
