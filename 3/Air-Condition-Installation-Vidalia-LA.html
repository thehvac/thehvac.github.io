<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Vidalia LA Home Owners</h3>
<p>Sean was very helpful. He is an extremely pleasant person to work with. No pressure applied to purchase additional things. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no problems other than the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>An undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to run because it needs to run longer than a correctly sized unit. A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate since it simply takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a chance to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The result is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In truth, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>

<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is an odorless, colorless toxic gas. Due to the fact that it is difficult to see, smell or taste, CO can kill you before you understand it is in your house. At lower levels of direct exposure, CO triggers mild results that are typically mistaken for the influenza. These signs consist of headaches, dizziness, disorientation, tiredness and queasiness. The results of CO direct exposure can differ significantly from individual to person depending on age, general health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
