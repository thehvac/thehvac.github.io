<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. While contaminants typically found in indoor air can trigger lots of harmful results, there is considerable uncertainty about what concentrations or periods of direct exposure are required to produce particular illness. Individuals also react really differently to exposure to indoor air contaminants. Additional research is required to much better understand which health results take place after direct exposure to the typical contaminant concentrations found in homes and which happens from the higher concentrations that occur for short time periods.<p>
<p>In a split-system central air conditioner, an outside metal cabinet consists of the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet contains the evaporator. In many split-system a/c, this indoor cabinet likewise consists of a furnace or the indoor part of a heatpump. The ac system's evaporator coil is installed in the cabinet or main supply duct of this furnace or heat pump. If your home already has a furnace but no air conditioner, a split-system is the most economical central air conditioning conditioner to install.<p>
