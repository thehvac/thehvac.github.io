<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC system than a smaller sized house, which will affect installation expenses. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can impact this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>A SEER score means Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER rating of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperatures throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input throughout the very same duration. Basically, SEER supplies more information based upon how the EER performs in different temperatures. The greater the unit's SEER score, the more energy efficient it is. 1 An unit's SEER rating can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all home appliances.<p>
