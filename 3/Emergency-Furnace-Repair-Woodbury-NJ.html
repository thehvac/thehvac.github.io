<p>SysTech Style concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment.

It also prevents water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>

Kids might have greater exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>
