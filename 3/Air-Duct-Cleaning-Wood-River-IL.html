<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, workers attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more difficulties, since a few of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. However, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>
