<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you must look out for. First, you need to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
