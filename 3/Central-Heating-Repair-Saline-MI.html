<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have issues, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
