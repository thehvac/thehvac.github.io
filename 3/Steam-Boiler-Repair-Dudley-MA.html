<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide car debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Scott Hauncher, a partner at Huron Capital, stated Pueblo looks for more than just additional earnings or scale when it makes acquisitions - it tries to find companies that can expand Pueblo's customer base or supply a new line of services.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
