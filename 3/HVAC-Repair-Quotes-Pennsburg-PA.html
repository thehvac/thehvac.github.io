If you've evaluated the air in your home and found a radon issue, and you have a well, get in touch with a laboratory accredited to determine radiation in water to have your water evaluated. Radon issues in water can be easily fixed. Call your state radon workplace or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more details.<p>

Follow the manufacturer's instructions, particularly directions on the proper fuel and keeping the heating unit effectively changed. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is generally a sign of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions.
