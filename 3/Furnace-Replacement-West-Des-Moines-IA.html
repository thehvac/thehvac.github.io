<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
