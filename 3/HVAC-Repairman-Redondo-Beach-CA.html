<p>Resideo uses a variety of energy-efficient Whole-House Ventilation System solutions for both brand-new construction and retrofit applications. Breathing air contaminants can lead to asthmatic and allergic reactions, infections and other health issue that include the lungs, nose and throat.

Secondhand smoke is likewise harmful to individuals, particularly children.<p>
<p>The first a/c unit and fridges employed poisonous or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could lead to deadly accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion home and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

Area control includes moving the contaminant source far from residents and even transferring vulnerable residents.<p>
