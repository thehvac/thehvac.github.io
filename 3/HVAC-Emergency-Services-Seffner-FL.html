<p>I have been using them for many years for my companies, my own homes and my realty customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He assisted me problem shoot the concern when I called and he recommended me to contact guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again. He is honest, reliable, and reasonable on rate. It's difficult to find a truthful AC person and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
