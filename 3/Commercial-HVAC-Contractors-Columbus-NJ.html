<p>Details supplied in this security guide is based upon present clinical and technical understanding of the issues provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders established by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. Buildings constantly progress as a result of the changes in the environment around them as well as the occupants, materials, and activities within them. The various surface areas and the air inside a structure are constantly interacting, and this interaction results in modifications in each. For example, we might see a window as changing a little in time as it becomes filthy, then is cleaned up, accumulates dirt once again, is cleaned up once again, and so on through its life. In reality, the dirt" we see may be developing as an outcome of the interactions among the wetness, chemicals, and biological products discovered there.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
