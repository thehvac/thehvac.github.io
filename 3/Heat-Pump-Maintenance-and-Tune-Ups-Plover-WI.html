<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips for Your Home in Plover WI</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing Waychoff for about ten years. Initially, they repaired a bad installation from a previous company. Thereafter, they have maintained my system semi-annually. Their techs are extremely well-informed and professional. Costs are sensible. Always on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff installed a brand-new air handler and condenser this week. Because the cost was clearly reasonable, I did not bother to get competitor's quotes because of my trust in Waychoff.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
