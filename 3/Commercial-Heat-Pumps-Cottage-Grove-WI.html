<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the standard water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the conventional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be shut down completely.<p>

<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance at Cottage Grove WI</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really happy that somebody as skilled as Adam had the ability to return and fix the air conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance plan, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to test the a/c unit before you buy. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam said he had methods to test AC units even in winter season. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
