<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings through natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of processes which leads to the supply and elimination of air from inside a building." Those processes consist of bringing in outside air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the building, and moving some part of indoor air exterior. If several of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
