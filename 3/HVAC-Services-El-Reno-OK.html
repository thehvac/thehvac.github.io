<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden flooring joist system, beneath the wooded subsurface and last flooring finish. This is usually used in a second or third-floor  location and takes advantage of the floor joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and additional density of an in-screed concrete put.

One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the floor surface.
