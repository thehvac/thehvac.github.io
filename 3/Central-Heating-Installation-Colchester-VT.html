Now the "hard part" once a year shut off the electricity open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy.

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile hose) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
