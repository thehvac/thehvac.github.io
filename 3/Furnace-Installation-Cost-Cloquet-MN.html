<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>This is especially noteworthy, as gas ranges can cause levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with poorly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
