He got along, uncomplicated and a completely enjoyable person to have around that whole time. His time and knowledge to SOLVE the concern cost us less than what we paid the other company just to do a somewhat unsure diagnostic.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the visit. They recommended replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the go to or the new part.
