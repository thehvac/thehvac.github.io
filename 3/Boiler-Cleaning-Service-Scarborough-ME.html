<h3>Signs It's Time to Replace Your Boiler in Scarborough ME</h3>
<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise homes bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has watched the single-family home installation service completely turn on its head the last few years. Winter season used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times swelling to approximately 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not simply with newcomers more familiar with AC living. Longtime Seattle house owners are finally giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>

Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
