Our pointer to any property buyers: employ Blue Flame to evaluate the air conditioning system before you buy.

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a reference later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
