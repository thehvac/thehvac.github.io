<p>I am extremely impressed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years ago and understand the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>

They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for seven years, although it was six months prior to the present one ended. She didn't require a air purification system, however they talked her into it.<p>
