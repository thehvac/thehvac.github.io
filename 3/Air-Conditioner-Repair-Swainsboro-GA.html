<h3>Boiler Cleaning Service in Swainsboro Georgia</h3>
<p>If you think a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
