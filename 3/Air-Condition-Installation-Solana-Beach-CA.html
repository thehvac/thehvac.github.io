<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
