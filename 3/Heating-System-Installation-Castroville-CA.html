<h3>Frequent Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Castroville CA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his assessment, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have found them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was necessary and renovated the whole plenum and the duct for the hot water heater because the technicians thought they simply didn't seem ideal and they couldn't leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
