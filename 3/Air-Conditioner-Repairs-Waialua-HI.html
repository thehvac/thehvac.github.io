Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the a/c will require more energy to cool your house. A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air, a ductless system, or a heat pump, everything needs to be changed ultimately. As equipment ages, it becomes less effective. Central air conditioning systems and heatpump typically last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last approximately twenty years. If your system is near, or past, its expected life expectancy, replacement may be the most cost-effective service.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a reference in the future). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
