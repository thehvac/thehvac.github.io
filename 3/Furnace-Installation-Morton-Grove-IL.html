<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are susceptible to cold areas", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and extremely hot next to the radiators. This generally leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up the house escape out of the window. Convected heat provides heat from the floor up throughout the space without any cold spots or stuffiness in the location being warmed.<p>
<p>Think about a whole home dehumidifier if your single stage air conditioner isn't old sufficient to validate replacement. By installing dehumidification devices inside an existing single stage system, you can enjoy some of the advantages of a variable speed compressor without changing any equipment. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfy level, enhancing indoor air quality and allowing greater convenience at greater temperatures.<p>
