<h3>Choosing the Right HVAC System For Your Project in Petaluma CA</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely delighted that someone as skilled as Adam had the ability to return and repair the air conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to test the a/c unit before you purchase. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to test AC systems even in winter. We wish we had known him then.<p>
