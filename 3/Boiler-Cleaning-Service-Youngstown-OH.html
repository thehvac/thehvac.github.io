<h3>Is The Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Youngstown OH?</h3>
<p>The icing issue becomes far more severe with lower outside temperatures, so heatpump are typically set up in tandem with a more conventional form of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized rather of the heat pump during harsher winter season temperature levels. In this case, the heatpump is utilized efficiently during the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the traditional heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
