<p>A Lot Of Midtown Houston Tx customers don't know why their HVAC system is not working when they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good idea of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil.
