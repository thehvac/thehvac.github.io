<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
