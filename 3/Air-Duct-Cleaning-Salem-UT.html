<p>We're Not Simply Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to watch out for is the dust that collects during summer seasons. The best thing to do is making certain that the heating unit burners are checked and cleaned thoroughly prior to colder seasons start. Always make certain that the furnace is cleaned up each year to prevent soot and condensation which triggers burners to quit working appropriately. If your furnace is in an extremely bad condition, maybe it is time to start thinking about purchasing a brand-new one.<p>
<p>Place the solar tank near the standard hot water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank, ensure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are accessible. It is most likely that it is supported by the plumbing if the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank. Install unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed.<p>
