<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating systems are still extensively utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
