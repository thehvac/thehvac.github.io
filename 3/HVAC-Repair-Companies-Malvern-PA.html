<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating systems are still extensively utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up regularly, they can become blocked with debris that can limit airflow, possibly impacting your comfort and your system's performance.

<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For instance, human beings breathe out co2, which in small amounts is not toxic, but might end up being dangerous if high concentrations are permitted to build up. Micro-organisms or germs might also exist within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do develop, they may spread throughout the entire work environment or structure by ways of the ventilation system.<p>
