<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
