To make certain the system you choose is the right size for your home, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load estimation estimate to identify the exact type of heat and cooling system that's perfect for your home-we do not simply replace it with the very same size system you presently have. These calculations take into account things such as the size of your house, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is necessary so the system isn't too little or too large-both waste energy.<p>
