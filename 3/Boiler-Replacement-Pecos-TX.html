(If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
