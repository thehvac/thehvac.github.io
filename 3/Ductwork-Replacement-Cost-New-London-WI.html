<p>The function of a lot of building ventilation systems is to bring in sufficient fresh air for occupant comfort while controlling temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and constructing security at reasonable energy costs. Load determining is referred to as the Handbook J computation and should be performed by the HVAC contractor before giving an installation or unit cost for a/c. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning unit you need based on experience or on square video alone. Similar to measuring the size of an unit needed based on BTUs, determining the proper size of system for your home also depends upon the system load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
<p>Oil heating units are less common now than gas, however they can be beneficial in more remote areas where utilities are harder to gain access to, and in chillier environments since it supplies more heat per BTU than other options. The installation cost will be lower, however energy costs will be greater, as much as three times greater than gas or electric furnaces. They need a tank on the immediate residential or commercial property and more maintenance. Overall, they cost in between $2,000 and $8,000 to install. Overall, they provide an AFUE rating of between 80 and 90 percent.<p>
