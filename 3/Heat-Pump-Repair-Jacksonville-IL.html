<p>The most typical type of house heater in the U.S. burns natural gas or propane to produce heat. With a typical cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least pricey alternative, but newer systems can be very energy efficient.

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product with time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
