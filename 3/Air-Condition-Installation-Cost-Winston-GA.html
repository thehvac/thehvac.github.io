<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace professionals frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on.

Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

Likewise, if the air conditioning unit smells bad, there could be germs accumulation on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil absorbs the heat far from your house. It will draw from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the air conditioner's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>Lots of HVAC company owner do not recognize they require different pricing schemes for different services that their company offers. For example, residential HVAC installation ought to be priced in a different way from commercial HVAC installation, and an HVAC service should be priced differently from duct cleaning.

<h3>Things to Search for When Hiring an Winston GA HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature level, and after that switch it ON. To avoid straining an ac system's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>

<p>They were excellent! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally asked for. They fulfilled my requirements entirely by offering a professional quote with alternatives, without pushing extra products.
