<h3>HVAC Service Technician in Salem AL 36874</h3>
<p>One of the downsides of central heating is that it's potentially pricey to set up, especially in an older home. Depending upon the kind of unit set up, it can be loud and cause issues if you're highly allergic to dust. Furthermore, certain fuels and equipment may require unique licenses, and there is minimal versatility in case of changed heating requirements. During use, there is a time delay while heat is being transferred from the heating system to the home.<p>
<p>This is particularly notable, as gas stoves can trigger levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with improperly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
