They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
