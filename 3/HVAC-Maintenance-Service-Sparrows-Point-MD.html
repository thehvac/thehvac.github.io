If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps an unclean burner.<p>

<p>When our furnace was passing away, we contacted 2 local companies for bids. While both were practical and informative, Ballard Gas offered us a much better deal, for exceptional service. Instead of a simple sales task, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heater and located ways we might have more even heat. He included these minor however considerable modifications in his bid.
