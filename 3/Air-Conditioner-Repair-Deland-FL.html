<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to discover a location that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Since it tires warm air out the top, don't place the condenser under a deck or entirely confine it. Any airflow restriction will decrease the system's performance. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at specific risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product in time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
