<p>When mounting a wall sensor, consider the height at which they must be positioned. Most typically they are mounted at height-level or slightly lower, if people mostly stay seated in that specific area.

For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the highest concentrations inside buildings are usually near the ceiling. Conversely, ozone is heavier than air and stays near the floor.<p>
