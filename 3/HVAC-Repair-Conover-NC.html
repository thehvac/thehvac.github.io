<h3>Furnace Installation Cost in Conover NC 28613</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
