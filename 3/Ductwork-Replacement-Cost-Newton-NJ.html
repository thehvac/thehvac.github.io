<p>Remember, too, that you might want to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heatpump systems can have different heating and cooling capabilities. You might look for a heat pump more geared toward cooling capability and performance if you already have a house heating system. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to search for a design that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winters. The bright side is that the one significant downside of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the very hot or cold temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
