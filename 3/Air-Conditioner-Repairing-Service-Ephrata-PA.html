<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic.

Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<p>A geothermal desuperheater is very efficient and helpful, specifically throughout the Summer season while the system acts to cool one's home. Because the excess heat absorbed from within the house is performed into the hot water tank rather than being transferred back into the earth, this is. The result, for that reason, is free hot water! Moreover, throughout winter season, the heat from underground can be taken in to heat domestic water together with its main function of supplying area heating. This implies that cost savings are still realized throughout the chillier period. In fact, a desuperheater decreases winter water heating costs by around half.<p>
