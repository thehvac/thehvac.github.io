<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the flooring as a circulation system. Metal pipelines are rarely utilized due to long-lasting destructive issues. Essentially all hydronic glowing flooring heat systems today use 1/2 inch diameter plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is extremely versatile, won't rust and comes in long lengths, which allow PEX pipe to be woven with very little or no joints.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air due to the fact that my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose spent time fixing the problem, all the while describing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
