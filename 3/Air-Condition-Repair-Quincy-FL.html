<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical home.

The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather significant.<p>
