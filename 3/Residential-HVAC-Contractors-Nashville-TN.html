<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
