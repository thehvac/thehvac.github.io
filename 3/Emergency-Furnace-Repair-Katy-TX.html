<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal studies that repeated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at specific danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and individuals with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator.
