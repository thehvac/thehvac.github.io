<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost great but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
