<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems typically achieve a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while more recent, extremely effective natural gas heating systems can achieve AFUE scores as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
