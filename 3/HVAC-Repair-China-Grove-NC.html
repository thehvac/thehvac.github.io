<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in each month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to offer car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There should not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
