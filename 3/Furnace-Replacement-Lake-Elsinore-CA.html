<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a referral later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
