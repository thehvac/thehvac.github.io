<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, managing the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature of the flooring. All electrical wiring for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the location is dry and unobstructed.<p>
<p>Through normal usage and the unit's presence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioning system might end up being extremely dirty.
