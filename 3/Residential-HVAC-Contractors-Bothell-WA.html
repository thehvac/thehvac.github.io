<p>Excellent Item! Shipment was type of odd being that package was opened and items could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was extremely lite weight and requires time to use. Note: buy suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with assistance, we resolved concerns. I would suggest this item to anybody who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the very first time.

<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as important as a regular oil change in your cars and truck. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps contaminants and particles in the air. Energy Star suggests replacing your filter once every three months. During high usage months, check the filters at least regular monthly.<p>
