<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Issues in Uniontown OH</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transmitting the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>

For instance, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
