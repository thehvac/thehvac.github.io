<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
