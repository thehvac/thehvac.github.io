<p>It may feel cozy being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, however for people who are sensitive to indoor allergens or have breathing problems, winter can exacerbate issues. Stale indoor air and heating systems can increase the amount of allergy-inducing dust mites, animal dander, and mold spores circulating through your house. In late winter season and early spring, it might still be too cold to toss open the windows to take out the moldy air, so while you await the warmer weather condition it is very important to be knowledgeable about a few of the allergy and breathing triggers that might be prowling in your environments.<p>
<p>A 3rd method to choose whether your home might have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, search for indications of issues with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can show your home might not have adequate ventilation include moisture condensation on windows or walls, foul-smelling or stuffy air, filthy central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other products end up being moldy. To spot smells in your house, step outside for a couple of minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether odors are noticeable.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
