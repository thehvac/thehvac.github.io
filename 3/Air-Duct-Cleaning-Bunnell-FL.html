<h3>Air Conditioner Reviews in Bunnell FL 32110</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
