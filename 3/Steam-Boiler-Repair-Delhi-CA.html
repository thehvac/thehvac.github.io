<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with routine preventive maintenance, though, there will constantly be the odd issue that occasionally turns up. When you do see your furnace acting strangely, it is very important that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as quickly as possible.

<h3>Choosing the Ideal HVAC System For The Job in Delhi CA</h3>

<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature level, and then switch it ON. To avoid straining an a/c's compressor, wait at least five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
