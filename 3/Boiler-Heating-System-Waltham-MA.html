The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they use air to exchange heat, in the exact same way as a cars and truck radiator or typical household air conditioning system does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it.

<h3>Methods to Get the Most From Your HVAC System in Waltham MA</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current pattern in home building is to lower air leakage through fractures and other openings in roofings, walls, and floorings. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh makeup air helps and waters down indoor pollutants tire them from the home.<p>
