<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should watch out for. First, you must examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
