<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ¬∞ C (40-55 ¬∞ F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must momentarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
