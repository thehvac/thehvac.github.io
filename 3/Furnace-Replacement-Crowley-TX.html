<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them till they have actually been correctly dried. If items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
