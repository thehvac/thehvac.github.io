<p>Today, countless allergen, dead skin cells, building and construction particles, and mold may be living in your home's air ducts, impacting the air you breathe as well as the performance of your heating and cooling system. There are several design techniques in use today; however, all ground source heatpump operate with similar concepts.

These various heat sources likewise dictate the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
