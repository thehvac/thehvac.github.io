<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material with time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
