<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold.

To make up for this, the heat pump system should momentarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
