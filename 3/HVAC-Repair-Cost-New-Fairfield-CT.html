<h3>Choosing the Right New Fairfield CT Company For Heating Repair</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his evaluation, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
