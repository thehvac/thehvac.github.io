<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>

<p>The predominant health result connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your risk of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
