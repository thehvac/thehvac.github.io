<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
