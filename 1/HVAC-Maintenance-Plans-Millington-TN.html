<p>Because it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your home through ducts, and cool air is gathered through cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are ranked for effectiveness. Older systems from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly simple process. Installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite pricey if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>

<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
