<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
