<p>Indoor pollutants. These consist of chemicals used in the building or remodelling of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these home appliances (cook ranges, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops should be used with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances need to be sealed and power-vented systems set up to eliminate products of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning ranges can also create particulates and must be vented outside.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are extremely complicated and building occupants may be exposed to a variety of contaminants (in the kind of particles and gases) from office makers, cleaning items, building and construction carpets, activities and home furnishings, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), bugs, and outside pollutants.
