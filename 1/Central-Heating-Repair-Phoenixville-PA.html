<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide need to be adjusted often, and outside measurements used for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>
