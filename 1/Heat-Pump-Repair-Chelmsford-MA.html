<p>Among the disadvantages of central heating is that it's potentially expensive to set up, specifically in an older home. Depending on the kind of unit set up, it can be noisy and trigger issues if you're extremely adverse dust. In addition, particular fuels and equipment might need special authorizations, and there is restricted versatility in the event of changed heating requirements. Throughout usage, there is a dead time while heat is being transferred from the heating unit to the living space.<p>
<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts decades, because it is protected inside. When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical guidelines remove the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are often more challenging to manage than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity ought to be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
