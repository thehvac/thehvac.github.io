<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor unit as near to the house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
