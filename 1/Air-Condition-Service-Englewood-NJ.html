I'm likewise pleased that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year.

Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transmitted by animals and individuals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander.
