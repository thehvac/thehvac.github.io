<h3>House Ventilation in Nashville AR 71852</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in lots. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.
