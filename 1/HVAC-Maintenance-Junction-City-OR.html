<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash being available in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There need to not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
