<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
