<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
