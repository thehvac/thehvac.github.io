<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace professionals typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heating systems, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing warm water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the space.<p>
