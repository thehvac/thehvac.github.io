<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the very same. Once the wiring is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly solidify and cure-- generally two to 4 weeks.
