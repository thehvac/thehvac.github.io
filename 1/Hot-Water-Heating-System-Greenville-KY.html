<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Companies in Greenville</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of common air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or two. Unscrew the old AC contactor before removing the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Image 6).<p>
