<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating equipment can last for several years. However if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel expenses all of a sudden appear higher than regular, it is probably time to consider a new system.

<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area. All items in the hot zone reach stability in temperature level after the radiant heat system has been operating for a while, consisting of individuals. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off.<p>
