<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
