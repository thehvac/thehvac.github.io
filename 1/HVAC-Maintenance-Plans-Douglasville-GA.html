<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heaters are still extensively used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>

<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even small window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions warrant. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
