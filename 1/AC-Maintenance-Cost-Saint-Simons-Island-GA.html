<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Things HVAC Repairin Saint Simons Island GA</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely happy that someone as knowledgeable as Adam had the ability to fix the air and return conditioner. We had acquired the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any homebuyers: employ Blue Flame to test the air conditioning system before you buy. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam said he had methods to check AC units even in winter season. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a tube twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electrical power open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
