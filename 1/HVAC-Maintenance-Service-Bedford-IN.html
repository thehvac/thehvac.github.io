<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to alter your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as essential as a routine oil change in your cars and truck. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, clean filter better traps impurities and debris in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star recommends changing your filter. During high use months, examine the filters at least monthly.<p>

<h3>Assessing the Performance of Your HVAC System at Bedford IN</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transferring the taken in heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

However, choose your contractor sensibly, a number of the 'trusted' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales techniques that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a credible company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the same).
