The installation cost will be lower, but energy costs will be greater, as much as three times greater than gas or electric heating systems.

<h3>Energy Efficient Heaters in Mount Holly NC 28120</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
