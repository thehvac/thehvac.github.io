PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have two different systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to supply heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the ac system into a heat pump While space cooling offers maximum versatility, when utilized to cool many spaces at a time it is generally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
