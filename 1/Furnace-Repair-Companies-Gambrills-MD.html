Possibly Realtors must consider a lot of variables to definitively mention what a radiant heating system might contribute to, or deduct from, any given asking price. That stated, property buyers seeking to go green," who focus on energy savings, or who absolutely want an in-floor heating unit will be willing to pay a premium for a home that includes one.<p>
