They weren't low-cost but a quick web search verified WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was extremely pleased they waited their work and repaired the problem. Will absolutely be using them again.<p>

<p>Because an air conditioning system moves heat between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both must be kept tidy. This indicates that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately lead to harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
