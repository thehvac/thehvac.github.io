<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace in La Grange NC</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
