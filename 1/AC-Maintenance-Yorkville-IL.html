<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things initially. Make sure all the signs up in the house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the lowered airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
