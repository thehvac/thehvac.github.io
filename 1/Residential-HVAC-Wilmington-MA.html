<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures via natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products include vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. When they are handled in a way that creates dust including asbestos fibers which can be breathed in, these products present a danger just. When asbestos-containing materials are damaged or disturbed by repair, redesigning, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can end up being air-borne if correct controls are not in place. This can result in the potential for substantial health issue.<p>
