<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do not accept them up until they have been appropriately dried. If products with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
