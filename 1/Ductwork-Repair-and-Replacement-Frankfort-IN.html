<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material gradually. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
