<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance items that only a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can lead to expensive compressor failure, but a homeowner doesn't have the tools or abilities required to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and proper air flow are important to a well-functioning system, however house owners lack the required equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still required to have a professional technician inspect the system periodically.<p>
<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system likewise may contribute to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced on a regular basis might end up being clogged, lowering air circulation circulation, volume, and quality. They also may become locations for molds and bacteria to grow and be dispersed throughout the house. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also must be correctly kept to prevent germs and mold contamination.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, providing warm air to private bed rooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
