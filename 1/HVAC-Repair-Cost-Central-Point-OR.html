<p>How environment change affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern-day ac system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the a/c unit boost. This boost has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The ac system's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
