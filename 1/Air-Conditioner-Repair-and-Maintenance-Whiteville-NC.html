<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is typically higher than many heat pump options, they can still be highly effective, depending upon the design you buy. One of the main benefits of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to higher temperature levels than other heating alternatives.

<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues.
