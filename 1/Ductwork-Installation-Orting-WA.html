<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you may not have an issue as long as your home still heats to the ideal temperature level. The temperature of the air produced by the heat pump will not necessarily be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel very hot. Just be worried if your house is not heating up. However, if your system does not seem working appropriately, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you should hire an expert to repair the unit and examine.<p>
