<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the see. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a fast web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning.

<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
