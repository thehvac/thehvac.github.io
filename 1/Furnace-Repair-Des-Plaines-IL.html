<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Des Plaines IL Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even small window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be replaced or washed as conditions call for. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, very unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Do not worry! Your Nest thermostat is still ok; it just may need 24 volts of electrical power.

There are various reasons that your Nest appears dead or has a blank screen. We'll be going over why you may be having trouble with your Nest smart thermostat. Examine your emergency breakers first. You should have the right amount of high voltage going to your furnace. If you have the proper 120 volts of power going to the furnace, examine.

It looks like a light switch in the attic. There are lots of wires in your furnace.<p>
