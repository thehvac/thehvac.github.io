Pressed wood products made for indoor use consist of: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furnishings); wood plywood paneling (utilized for ornamental wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops). Medium density fiber board consists of a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pushed wood product and is normally acknowledged as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood product.<p>

<p>There is no easy response, but many utilize the guideline that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is probably a much better service.
