<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you ought to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
