Today's heating systems are ranked 90% efficiency or much better; it is not uncommon for a contemporary furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older models, which might be ranked as low as 80% effectiveness, this can mean considerable savings in annual heating costs. Modern two- and three-stage heaters increase effectiveness even further by performing at lower or higher capability depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of various heating systems, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
