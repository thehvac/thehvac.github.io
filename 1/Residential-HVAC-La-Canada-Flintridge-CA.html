<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood just what the problem was and fixed it extremely quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
