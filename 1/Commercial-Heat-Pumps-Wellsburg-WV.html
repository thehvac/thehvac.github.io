<p>If your a/c unit is more than 8 years of ages, repair is probably not worth the expenditure, unless it's a basic issue like debris obstructing the condenser system or a worn fan belt. Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace decision, ask your contractor to assess not simply the condition of your existing devices, but also the ducts that provide the cool air and the total quality of the insulation in your home. Improving those components might increase the efficiency of the system as much or more than installing new equipment.<p>
