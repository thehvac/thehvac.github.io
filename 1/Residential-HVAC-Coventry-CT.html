<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is absorbed from indoors and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless toxic gas. Due to the fact that it is difficult to see, taste or smell, CO can kill you before you understand it remains in your house. At lower levels of exposure, CO causes mild results that are often mistaken for the influenza. These signs include headaches, lightheadedness, disorientation, tiredness and nausea. The results of CO exposure can differ considerably from individual to individual depending upon age, total health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
