<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product with time.
