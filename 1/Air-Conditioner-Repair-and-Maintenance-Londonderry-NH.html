<h3>Assessing Commercial Boilers to Residential Boilers at Londonderry NH</h3>
<p>I admit I have not done the math lately, but I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular examinations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the system sits. I seem like they offer me favoritism, and want to pay a bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
