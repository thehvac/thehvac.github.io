Numerous common building products utilized before 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Normally, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not occur unless the building materials are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building remodelling. Because the fibers can be spread into the air during the elimination process, elimination of asbestos-containing materials is not always optimum. A management program for undamaged asbestos-containing materials is frequently recommended instead.<p>
