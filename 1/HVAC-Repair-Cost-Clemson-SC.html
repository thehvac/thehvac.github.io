<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a referral later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've switched all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
