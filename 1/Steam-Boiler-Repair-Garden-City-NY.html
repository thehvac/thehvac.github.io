<p>Airborne irritants are just a truth of life. Molds can trigger flare-ups of allergic reaction signs, and in many cases, trigger asthma attacks. Bacteria, germs, and infections also can live in the air you breathe every day. These air-borne contaminants can impact your home convenience equipment, too. Permitted to flow through your house and your system, these and other particles can build up on the indoor coil, inhibiting air flow and lowering heating and cooling performance. By using the services and items we offer, you can reduce and often remove these undesirable airborne toxins from your house, leaving tidy air and safe surfaces throughout your household.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release pollutants.) Nevertheless, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
