<p>Proper ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with an older name. The company started in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature clients for decades, up until the mandate for high-efficiency systems required Goettl to end production. The contracting side of business continued under several owners. Goodrich's father was a Goettl dealership in Las Vegas, so when the chance came to purchase what was left of the company in 2013, he took it.<p>
<p>The very first air conditioning unit and refrigerators utilized combustible or toxic gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might lead to fatal accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
