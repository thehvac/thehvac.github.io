<h2>How To Hire Affordable HVAC Contractor in Manassas</h2>

<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating units are still extensively used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
