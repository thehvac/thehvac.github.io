If your heating unit is 25 years of ages or more, you can most likely anticipate to cut your fuel costs in half.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that allows the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system elements, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
