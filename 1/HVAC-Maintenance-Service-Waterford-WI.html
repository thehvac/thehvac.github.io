<p>All homes need efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has actually been stressed out from usage. Another possible factor might be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the proper temperature. Furnaces that kick on frequently may be because of a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled and even a filthy burner.<p>

Install unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever require to be replaced.<p>

He committed to the task based just on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of affordable ones got.
