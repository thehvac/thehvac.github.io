<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things first. Ensure all the registers in your house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

<p>The primary health impact connected with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
