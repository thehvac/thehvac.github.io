<p>The main factor property owners do not purchase an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 annually, depending on the quantity of services provided.

<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose spent time troubleshooting the problem, all the while explaining everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working effectively. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
