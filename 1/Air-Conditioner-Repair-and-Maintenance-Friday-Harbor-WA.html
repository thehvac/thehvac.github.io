Not only was the rate excellent however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
