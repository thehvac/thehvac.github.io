<h3>Understanding the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Saugus MA</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heater need relatively little attention. However, just like any mechanical system, some standard maintenance is necessary to keep the system operating efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater are similar to those of standard hot water heater. The collectors, piping and tank need to be looked for leaks, the system should be flushed occasionally to get rid of tank and collected pollutants (scaling in difficult water locations). The systems need to be checked at least twice each year for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be washed periodically to eliminate dust collected in order to enhance collector performance.<p>
<p>An undersize system won't be able to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to run due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a properly sized unit. Due to the fact that it just takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to run. And an oversize system does not lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a possibility to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed moisture. The outcome is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In fact, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>

<p>I am very pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years back and understand the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
