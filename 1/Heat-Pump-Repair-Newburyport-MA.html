<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating units are still commonly used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>A SEER score represents Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER ranking of a system is the cooling output at varying temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the same period. Basically, SEER supplies more data based upon how the EER carries out in various temps. The higher the unit's SEER ranking, the more energy efficient it is. 1 An unit's SEER ranking can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all home appliances.<p>

<p>I had a terrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company used 98% of the existing product purchased with your house.
