<h3>Advantages of Expert AC Repair in Monticello GA</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current trend in house construction is to decrease air leakage through fractures and other openings in floors, walls, and roofings. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor contaminants and assists tire them from the house.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
