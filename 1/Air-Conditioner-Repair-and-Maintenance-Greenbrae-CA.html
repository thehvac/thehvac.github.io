<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me top priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
