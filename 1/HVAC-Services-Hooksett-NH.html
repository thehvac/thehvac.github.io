If the signs fade or go away when an individual is away from the area, for example, an effort needs to be made to recognize indoor air sources that might be possible causes.

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a reference later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
