<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to briefly switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
