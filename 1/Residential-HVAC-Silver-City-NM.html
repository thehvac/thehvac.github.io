<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a referral later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Eliminate the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
