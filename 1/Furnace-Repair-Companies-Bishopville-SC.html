<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace technicians frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do decline them until they have actually been effectively dried. If products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent gos to, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
<p>People operating in structures with bad IAQ might discover unpleasant or moldy smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>
