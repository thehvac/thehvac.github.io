<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either since of visible growth or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't eliminate the mold.

Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
