<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in tons. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.
