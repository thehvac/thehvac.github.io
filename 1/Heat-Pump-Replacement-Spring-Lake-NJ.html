<h3>Boiler Maintenance at Spring Lake NJ - Reasons Why You Would Have to Reset The Boiler</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Oil heaters tend to be greater in maintenance than other types. They produce a lot of soot, which requires to be effectively vented and cleaned from the furnace regularly. Change the filters regularly and have your ductwork cleaned up because the soot develops inside the ducts, decreasing their performance with time. Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and tidy your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
