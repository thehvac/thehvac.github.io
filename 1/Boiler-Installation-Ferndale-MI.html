<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Installation in Ferndale Michigan</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a musty smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Leaky return ducts can likewise present wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Even with the best system and correct installation, there's always the possibility that your furnace will malfunction.
