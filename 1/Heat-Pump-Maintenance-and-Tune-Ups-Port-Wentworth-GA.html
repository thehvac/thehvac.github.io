<p>The homes and composition of the soil in an area can affect the rate at which heat is performed through the ground. These need to be considered before choosing the best design of an underground heating & cooling system. Soil with favorable heat transfer homes requires fewer pipelines to achieve the desired underground cooling and heating effect, while those with minimized thermal conductivity will require more pipes.<p>
