<h3>Furnace Maintenance  in North Vernon Indiana</h3>
<p>The use of air filters can trap a few of the air contaminants. The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy section suggests that "Air Purification need to have a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as figured out by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation needed Air filters are used to reduce the amount of dust that reaches the damp coils. Dust can work as food to grow molds on the wet coils and ducts and can decrease the effectiveness of the coils.<p>

<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips for Your Home in North Vernon IN</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, determined particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Since an a/c moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both must be kept tidy. This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise needed to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
