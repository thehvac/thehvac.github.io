<p>These people have been fantastic. At a realtor, I sometimes require contractors to offer me an opinion for what work on a home might cost. Just recently I required to call on these men twice.

<p>Geothermal heat pump cost is much more than other heat pump types when setting up the whole system. Geothermal systems need underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy. Setting up one included excavation, running hundreds of backyards of piping, burying the loop, and more. This process is rather pricey. Setting up a new geothermal heat pump to deal with an existing ground loop is far less expensive.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood just what the problem was and fixed it extremely rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
