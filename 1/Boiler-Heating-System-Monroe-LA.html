Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
