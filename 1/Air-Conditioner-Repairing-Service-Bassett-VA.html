<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside unit as near the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Things to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service at Bassett VA</h3>
<p>Another method to lowering the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your house is to increase the amount of outside air coming indoors. A lot of home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening windows and doors, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window air conditioning system with the vent control open boosts the outside ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen area fans that tire outdoors remove pollutants directly from the space where the fan is located and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is a colorless, odor-free gas that interferes with the delivery of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can cause unconsciousness and death. Lower concentrations can trigger a series of signs from headaches, d izziness, weak point, nausea, confusion, and disorientation, to tiredness in healthy people and episodes of increased chest discomfort in individuals with chronic cardiovascular disease. The symptoms of carbon monoxide gas poisoning are often puzzled with the flu or gastrointestinal disorder. Fetuses, infants, elderly individuals, and individuals with anemia or with a history of heart or respiratory disease can be particularly sensitive to carbon monoxide gas exposures.<p>
