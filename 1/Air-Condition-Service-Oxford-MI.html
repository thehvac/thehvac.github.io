<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
