<h3>Geothermal Heating And Cooling in Dickinson TX 77539</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
