<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
