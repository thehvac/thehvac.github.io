Climate Pro is trusted and truly cared about us and our situation. We got home one night to a cold home. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came by that very same night.

Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was definitely grateful to have a heated home once again. What's most incredible was that this all occurred during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover somebody to assist us right before a vacation, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will happily suggest this company to my buddies.<p>

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
