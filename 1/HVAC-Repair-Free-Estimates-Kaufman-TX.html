<h3>Maximizing the Efficiency of Your HVAC System in Kaufman TX</h3>
<p>In-floor heating unit can include specific health advantages. The hotter the air, the drier it becomes. On those days when you just can't appear to heat up and find you need to show up your thermostat, your furnace can draw all the humidity out of your home and leave your sinuses throbbing. In-floor heating systems are not susceptible to this problem due to the fact that they heat surfaces and not the air itself. Additionally, since they do not trust fans, ducts, registers and returns to distribute hot air, in-floor heating unit can lower the amount of dust and seasonal allergens in your house.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
