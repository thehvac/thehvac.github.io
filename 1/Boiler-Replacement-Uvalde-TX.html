<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Filthy Filters: â $ " Â Filters clogged with dust, pet hair and other debris cause problems like failure to provide appropriate heat, excess sound and the furnace running all the time.
