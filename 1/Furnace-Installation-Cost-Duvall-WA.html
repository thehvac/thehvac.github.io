<p>We called Elite HEATING AND COOLING on among the most popular days of summer( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out very same day to examine situation & chose to go with them for the work. I enjoy to say that not only did we get the central air going but also replaced the heating unit which was old. Everybody we talked with from starting to end were really expert, courteous and the work was very efficiently done. I would highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>Immediate effects may show up after a single direct exposure or duplicated exposures. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such immediate impacts are treatable and generally short-term. Often the treatment is simply getting rid of the individual's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be determined. Signs of some diseases, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may also show up right after direct exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge pollutants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Sometimes a short-lived indoor air quality problem is produced merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a space or structure, such as an overcrowded meeting area. In those cases, a short-term repair might be all that's needed, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. But more intricate concerns-- determined by regularly undesirable air quality tracking results-- will require a different tack. Depending upon the issue you're experiencing, among the 3 techniques below may be appropriate.<p>
