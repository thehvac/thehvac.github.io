<p>If your ac system is more than eight years of ages, repair is most likely not worth the expenditure, unless it's a simple problem like particles blocking the condenser unit or a used fan belt. Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace choice, ask your contractor to examine not simply the condition of your existing equipment, but also the ducts that deliver the cool air and the total quality of the insulation in your house.
