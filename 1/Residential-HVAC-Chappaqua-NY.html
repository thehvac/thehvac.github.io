<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the check out. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a fast internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the go to or the new part. I was very delighted they waited their work and fixed the problem. Will certainly be using them once again.<p>
