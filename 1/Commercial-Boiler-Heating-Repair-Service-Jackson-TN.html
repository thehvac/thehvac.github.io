<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
