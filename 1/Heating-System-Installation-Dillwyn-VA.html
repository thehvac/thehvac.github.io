<p>Central air units are determined in loads. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Your Evaluation This is my third time using Around the Clock. Ilan constantly makes himself readily available - whether it's a heating concern in the middle of the night in the depth of winter season to more regular calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is skilled with these devices). I have absolutely nothing but excellent things to state - he has taken good care of my heating and AC needs. Quick reaction - fast resolution.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the idea of an in-floor heating system appears less like a luxury item and more like a need. (Besides, warmed floorings were excellent enough for the Roman Empire) However before you commit to what can be a major renovation task, it's best to ask yourself whether a glowing floor heating unit is an appropriate service for your specific home heating requirements.<p>
