<h3>Furnace Service in Humble Texas</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the check out. They suggested changing a couple of parts that were heading out.

I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was very pleased they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will certainly be utilizing them once again.<p>
