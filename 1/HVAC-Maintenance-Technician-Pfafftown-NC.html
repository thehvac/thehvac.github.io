<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
