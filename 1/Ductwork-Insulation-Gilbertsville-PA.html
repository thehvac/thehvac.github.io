<p>Since an air conditioning system moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both must be kept clean. This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually result in damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
