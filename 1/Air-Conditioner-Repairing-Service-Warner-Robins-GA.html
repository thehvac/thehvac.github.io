<p>These guys have actually been excellent. At a realtor, I sometimes require contractors to provide me an opinion for what deal with a home may cost. Recently I needed to call on these men twice.

<p>In a packaged central air conditioner, the evaporator, condenser, and compressor are all situated in one cabinet, which typically is placed on a roof or on a concrete piece beside your house's structure. This type of air conditioning unit also is used in small commercial structures. Air supply and return ducts come from inside your home through the home's exterior wall or roofing system to connect with the packaged a/c, which is usually situated outdoors. Packaged ac system often consist of electric heating coils or a natural gas furnace. This combination of a/c unit and central heater gets rid of the need for a different furnace indoors.<p>
<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioner works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
