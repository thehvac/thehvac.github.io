<p>Irritants are products that trigger an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens discovered in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can become air-borne, and thus, are quickly inhaled. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For example, if you consider a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of cat allergen could induce an asthma attack in people with cat allergic reactions, but not in those individuals who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transmitted by individuals and animals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these impurities through the home.<p>
