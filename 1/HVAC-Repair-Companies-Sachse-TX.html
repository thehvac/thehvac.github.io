<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical house. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather substantial if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
