<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
