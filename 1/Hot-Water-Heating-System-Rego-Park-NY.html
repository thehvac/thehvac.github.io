<h3>Pool Heat Pump in Rego Park NY 11374</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>Brian was every bit truthful, pleasant and responsive. Jeremiah Bartula the plumbing technician discussed our alternatives prior to our work with Brian and was amazing, helpful and informative - his work was remarkable! All of his assistants were courteous and diligent. The work website was left utterly cleared and cleaned. We would extremely encourage others to go right to Berkshire Heating and Air Conditioning for all their heating and cooling requirements.<p>
<p>The main reason homeowners do not acquire an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 per year, depending upon the amount of services provided. If the system is new and still under a maker's warranty, the cost may not be worthwhile. Any major repairs should be covered under the manufacturer's warranty. Nevertheless, some producers need routine maintenance as a term of the warranty.<p>
