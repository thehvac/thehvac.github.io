<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Geographically, some locations pay consistently higher wages for air conditioning tradespersons. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, unfavorable environment, or merely a high level of competition for skilled trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's highest typical wages for HVAC service technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 each year. The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 annually. Massachusetts and Connecticut rounded out the five highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 per year.<p>
<p>There is no simple response, but many utilize the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is probably a much better option. If the existing system has actually not sustained other major repairs, is in otherwise exceptional condition, and issues that resulted in the breakdown can be recognized and treated, repairing the system can make a great deal of sense as well.<p>
<p>Nearly half of Americans use air fresheners a minimum of as soon as a week, and 34 percent usage candle lights or incense that frequently, our nationally representative study discovered. Approximately 40 percent seldom or never clean their humidifier or kitchen area variety hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have never ever cleaned up or changed their furnace filter. And almost 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can aggravate indoor air quality.<p>
