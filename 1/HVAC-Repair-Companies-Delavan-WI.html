<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor system as near your home as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment installed simply a couple of years back.<p>
<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensors: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface area ignitor) or electronic lighter spoils, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it closes down quickly. This is a very common repair. If your furnace is more than ten years old and youâ $ re having other service done on it, consider having the ignitor and flame sensing unit changed as preventative maintenance since the cost will be less when the technician is currently there and has the furnace opened for repairs.<p>
