<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that permits the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system parts, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
