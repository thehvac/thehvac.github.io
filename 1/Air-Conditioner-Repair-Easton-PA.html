There are emergency safety changes that safeguard your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most typical locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a great chance; you may have a water leak in the attic. The water activates your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer.
