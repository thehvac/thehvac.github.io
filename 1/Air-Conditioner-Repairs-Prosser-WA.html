<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
