<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have found them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was necessary and redid the entire plenum and the duct for the water heater due to the fact that the technicians thought they just didn't appear right and they couldn't leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>

<h3>Air Conditioning And Refrigeration in Bluefield VA 24605</h3>
<p>You're encouraging the growth of mold in wet air if you set it too low. The heat dries the air, avoiding mold growth and pollution. Naturally, too-dry air can also aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while excessive indoor humidity can contribute to the growth of bacteria and infections, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a house is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>In addition, worker health symptoms such as colds, headaches, drowsiness, irritation, and irregular breathing might be brought on as the result of temperature extremes, improper humidity levels, and insufficient or too much air circulation. Workplace temperature levels must be kept in between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts caused by excessive air circulation need to be avoided.<p>
<p>Allergens are products that cause an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens found in indoor air are mainly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can become airborne, and thus, are easily breathed in. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks.
