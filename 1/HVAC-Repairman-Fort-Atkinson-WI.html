<p>Unpredictable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals discharged as gases from procedures or products; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a brand-new carpet is likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could include unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within during water use.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in adequate outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
