Your heating and cooling contractor should examine and, if necessary, update the structure envelope. For example, he might seal gaps and cracks in the outer walls and attic floor, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling expenses. Insulation might be a more efficient solution to your cooling problems than replacing your equipment.<p>
