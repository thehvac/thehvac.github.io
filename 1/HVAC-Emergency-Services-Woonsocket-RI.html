<p>We called Elite HEATING AND COOLING on one of the most popular days of summer( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out exact same day to assess situation & chose to go with them for the work. I more than happy to say that not only did we get the central air conditioning going but also replaced the heating unit which was old. Everybody we talked with from starting to end were extremely professional, polite and the work was extremely effectively done. I would extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. Over time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors altered to prevent more damage to your system.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might wish to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump units can have different heating and cooling capabilities. You may look for a heat pump more tailored toward cooling capability and performance if you currently have a home heating system. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to search for a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winters. The good news is that the one major drawback of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the exceptionally hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>

Your air conditioning system is a critical part of your home during the heat, and if you require any kind of service for your a/c system, whether it's the installation of a new system or repairs for your existing system, our air conditioning technicians are ready to assist. We provide comprehensive cooling service in Fort Worth, Arlington & Flower Mound for cooling equipment of all types. We likewise supply a substantial series of service warranties and assurances for new installation jobs, so contact us to find out more.<p>
