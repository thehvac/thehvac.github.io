<h3>Choosing the Right Clover SC Company For Heating Repair</h3>
<p>Another approach to lowering the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your house is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming inside your home. Most home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening windows and doors, operating window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window air conditioner with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors eliminate impurities directly from the room where the fan is located and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
