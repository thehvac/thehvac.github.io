<p>Oil heating systems are usually not really efficient. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, but most do not achieve a performance higher than 90%. A few high-end brands have a performance of 95% by using a condenser. These are more pricey, having beginning expenses for the furnace itself at around $5,000. Due to the fact that a drain needs to be set up, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>
<p>A third method to choose whether your home may have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, search for signs of issues with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can suggest your house may not have adequate ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, smelly or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other products end up being moldy. To find odors in your house, action outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether odors are visible.<p>
<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose spent time repairing the issue, all the while discussing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
