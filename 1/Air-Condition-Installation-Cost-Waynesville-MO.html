<p>It might feel comfortable being sealed in tight against the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, however for people who are sensitive to indoor allergens or have breathing problems, winter season can worsen problems. Stagnant indoor air and heater can increase the quantity of allergy-inducing allergen, family pet dander, and mold spores distributing through your home.

<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system also may add to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not changed on a regular basis might end up being stopped up, lowering air flow distribution, volume, and quality.

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you need to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
