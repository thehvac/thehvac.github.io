This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>

Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load. Nevertheless, brand-new installation practices are decreasing expenses, to the point where the rate is getting closer to standard systems under the ideal conditions.<p>
