<p>A packaged system, generally set up on the roofing system, is most commonly utilized on commercial buildings, however it is also an alternative for house owners to think about. Oftentimes, these units consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are great for those looking to save money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system individually, since the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are generally just available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a great way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than buying just a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the best alternative for house owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
