After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. Sometimes, determined particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<h3>Ductwork Repair and Replacement in Dedham MA 02026</h3>
<p>I generally don't leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over choices. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
