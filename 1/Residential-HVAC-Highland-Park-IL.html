<h3>Home Furnace in Highland Park IL 60035</h3>
<p>I generally don't leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>

These symptoms might be promoted by poor indoor quality.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more tough to manage than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate.

The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
