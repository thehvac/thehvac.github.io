The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends upon how well it gathers pollutants from indoor air (revealed as a portion efficiency rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering aspect (expressed in cubic feet per minute).

The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends upon keeping it according to the producer's directions.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outside unit as near your home as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really get rid of countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>

<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by people and animals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. It can become air-borne when it dries.
