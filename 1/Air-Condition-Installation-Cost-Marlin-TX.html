<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise homes bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has seen the single-family house installation business completely turn on its head the last couple of years.

It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not simply with newbies more familiar with AC living. Long time Seattle property owners are finally giving up, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors significantly lowers exposure to contaminants during cooking. Inappropriate modification, frequently suggested by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame tip is blue. Think about buying one with pilotless ignition since it does not have a pilot light that burns continuously if you buy a new gas stove or range. Never use a gas stove to heat your home. Always make sure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in usage.<p>
