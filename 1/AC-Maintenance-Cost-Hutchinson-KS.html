So possibly a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>Space a/c feature a thermostat sensing unit, located behind the control board, which determines the temperature of air entering the evaporative coil. If the sensor is knocked out of position, the a/c unit might cycle continuously or act erratically.
