He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation many years ago and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
