<p>Heat pumps are a dream come to life for folks in Seattle. Air conditioning is something that a lot of Seattleites will only utilize moderately, but since heat pumps can offer both heating and cooling through a single system of ductwork, you'll have the best of both worlds!

<p>Some biological contaminants trigger allergies, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some types of asthma. Contagious diseases, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transferred through the air. Molds and mildews launch disease-causing contaminants. Signs of illness brought on by biological contaminants include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, lethargy, fever, and digestive issues.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
