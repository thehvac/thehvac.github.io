<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
