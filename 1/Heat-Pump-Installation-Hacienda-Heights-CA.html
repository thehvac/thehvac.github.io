<h3>The Most Common Reasons For Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even little window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be replaced or cleaned as conditions necessitate. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. In addition, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
