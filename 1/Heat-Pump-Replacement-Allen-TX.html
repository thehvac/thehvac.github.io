<h3>How to Limit the Prices of Air Conditioner Repair in Allen TX</h3>
<p>I admit I have not done the mathematics lately, but I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular assessments. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits. I feel like they give me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew simply what the problem was and fixed it really quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
