<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by building and construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures via natural and mechanical ventilation.
