In the outside system of this air conditioner there is a more powerful compressor, ports for connecting numerous traces and automation with locking valves for controling the volume of refrigerant provided to the indoor systems located in the space.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up routinely, they can become clogged with particles that can restrict air flow, possibly impacting your comfort and your system's effectiveness. Dirty filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace components and in more extreme cases cause the system to shut down entirely.

As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
