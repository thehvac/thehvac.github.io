<h3>Air Condition System in Bethpage New York</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a musty smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Leaky return ducts can likewise present moisture. Again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
