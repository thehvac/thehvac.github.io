<p>Specialist heating unit installations. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating system will eventually fail. HVAC professionals recommend following this basic rule when choosing whether it's worth buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than necessary.<p>

The installation cost will be lower, however energy costs will be greater, as much as three times greater than gas or electric heating systems.
