<p>Today, countless allergen, dead skin cells, building particles, and mold might be living in your home's duct, impacting the air you breathe along with the effectiveness of your heating and cooling system. There are numerous design techniques in usage today; however, all ground source heat pumps operate with comparable concepts. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop in between the surface units and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These different heat sources also determine the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat utilizing a closed loop.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor system as near to the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
