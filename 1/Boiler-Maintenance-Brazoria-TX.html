<p>SysTech Style specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system parts, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
