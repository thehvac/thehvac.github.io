<p>We recommend utilizing our insulation boards when setting up over concrete slabs. When utilized in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as a very effective thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of permitting heat to heat up the concrete slab listed below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>

Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon.

EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
