<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Yuma AZ</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, carried out a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving air flow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. In many cases, determined particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
