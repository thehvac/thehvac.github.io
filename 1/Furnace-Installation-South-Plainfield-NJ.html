<p>I normally do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about choices. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
