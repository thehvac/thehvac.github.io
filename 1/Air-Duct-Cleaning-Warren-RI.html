<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical product gradually. In truth, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
