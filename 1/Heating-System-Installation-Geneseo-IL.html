<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price excellent but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
