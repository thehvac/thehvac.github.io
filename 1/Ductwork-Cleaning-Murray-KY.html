<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash coming in monthly, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to provide vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
