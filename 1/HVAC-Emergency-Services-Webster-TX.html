<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical material in time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
