In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

That's since it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a possibility to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the essential moisture. The outcome is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In fact, the room can feel clammy and wet.<p>
