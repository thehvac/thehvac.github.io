To conserve energy and cash, you need to try to buy an energy-efficient a/c and minimize your central air conditioner's energy use. In an average air-conditioned house, a/c takes in more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per year, triggering power plants to discharge about 3,500 pounds of co2 and 31 pounds of sulfur dioxide.<p>
