<p>Structures are created or meant to respond actively to a few of these changes in and around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems.

In other cases, such modifications subtly or even considerably modify structures in manner ins which might be essential to their own stability or their influence on structure residents through the evolution of the physical, chemical, and biological procedures that specify them at any time.
