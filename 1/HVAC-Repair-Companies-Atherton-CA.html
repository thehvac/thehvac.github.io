<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
