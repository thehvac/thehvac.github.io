<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs silently and efficiently, however to have 2 major components stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by warranty.

<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
