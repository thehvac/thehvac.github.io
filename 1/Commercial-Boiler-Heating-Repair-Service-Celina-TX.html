<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your house that best temperature level throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those common air toxins. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can lead to costly repairs down the road. So, make certain to alter your AC filters regularly, or get a cooling service plan which usually includes a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is an odorless, colorless harmful gas. Since it is impossible to see, smell or taste, CO can eliminate you before you understand it remains in your house. At lower levels of exposure, CO causes mild effects that are frequently mistaken for the influenza. These symptoms include headaches, dizziness, disorientation, fatigue and queasiness. The impacts of CO exposure can differ greatly from person to individual depending upon age, total health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
