<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The selection of indoor units has one limitation: their total power must not surpass the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems higher than the outside capacity by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate much better performance when all indoor systems are switched on at the exact same time, because the total capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capability of the outdoor unit. Simply put, the outside system will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that some of the spaces might not have a very comfy temperature level. However, the calculation of the total power is not simple, considering that it considers not only the nominal power of the systems, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
