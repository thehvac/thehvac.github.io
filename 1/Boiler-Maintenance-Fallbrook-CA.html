<p>Central air is a high-end not everybody can pay for, a lot of Seattleites should find ways to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in big box shops like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC units are taken up as soon as they're stacked in floor screens.
