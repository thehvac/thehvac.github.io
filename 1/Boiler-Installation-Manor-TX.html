<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating enough outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
