<h3>Central Air Conditioning Repair in Rotonda West Florida</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either since of noticeable development or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and check. Leaky return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Great Product! Shipment was type of unusual being that package was opened and products could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all intact. The item was extremely lite weight and takes some time to apply. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we resolved concerns. I would suggest this product to anyone who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
