<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your home's square video footage. They use a series of computations based upon the British Thermal Systems or BTUs required to heat the space. The larger the space, the more powerful the home heater needs to be.

<p>As many of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all major devices maker's to guarantee your factory service warranties remain in place. Moreover, the tangible results of a PM is typically hard to measure, as one reaction specified the cost savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. A lot of pieces of a furnace or a/c unit don't simply break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the result of repeated usage of an element that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may fail too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing premature wear and tear, resulting in cracks and holes. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and secures the component.  an extremely helpful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
