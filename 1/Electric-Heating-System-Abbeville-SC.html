The job of an HVAC technician is fairly complicated and can differ considerably from one home or office to the next. Every maintenance task and repair is various from the last. Every maintenance job might require completely various steps and procedures than the previous, depending upon the age and condition of the system being inspected. Setups can likewise vary substantially, depending upon the age of the structure and how well the existing system was installed. In some cases, entirely brand-new ductwork may need to be installed in a structure that had none prior to.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside system as close to your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
