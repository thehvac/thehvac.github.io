<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you must check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
