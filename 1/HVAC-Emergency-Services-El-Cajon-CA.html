<h3>The Advantages of Buying A New Furnace in El Cajon CA</h3>
<p>In-floor heater can feature specific health benefits. The hotter the air, the drier it ends up being. On those days when you just can't appear to warm up and find you require to turn up your thermostat, your furnace can suck all the humidity out of your house and leave your sinuses pulsating.

Furthermore, since they do not rely upon fans, ducts, signs up and returns to distribute hot air, in-floor heating unit can reduce the amount of dust and seasonal allergens in your house.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
