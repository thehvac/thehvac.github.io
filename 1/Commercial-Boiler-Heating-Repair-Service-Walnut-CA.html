<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the standard hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut off totally.<p>

<p>Outside contaminants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a home, outside particulates can be drawn inside.
