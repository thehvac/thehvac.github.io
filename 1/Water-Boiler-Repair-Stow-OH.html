The main path of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol impact, a lot of frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly positioned or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which may go into neighboring ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and assisted living home, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outside water fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
