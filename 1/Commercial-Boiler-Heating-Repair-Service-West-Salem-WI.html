Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks.

Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The objective is to provide enough modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this.
