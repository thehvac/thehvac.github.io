<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
