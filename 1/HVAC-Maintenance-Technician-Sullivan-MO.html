<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product gradually. In reality, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
