<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash being available in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use car debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
