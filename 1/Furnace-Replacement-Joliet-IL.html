<p>Heat pumps are a dream come true for folks in Seattle. Cooling is something that a lot of Seattleites will only use moderately, but since heat pumps can supply both heating and cooling through a single system of ductwork, you'll have the very best of both worlds! Not only are heatpump practical, they are incredibly energy efficient, too. The best time to set up air conditioning in your home may very well be when your heating system breaks down if a heat pump is in your future.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps just as important when it pertains to central air conditioning costs, is the AC system's size. A system that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not be able to effectively cool the house on hot days. Considering larger systems cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
