We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating unit. We chose getting something more pricey than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our greatest utility costs. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
