He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years earlier and understand the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year.
