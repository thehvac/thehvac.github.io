<p>The very first a/c unit and refrigerators employed combustible or harmful gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could result in fatal accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>A customized a/c unit that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, however differs from a basic a/c unit in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air course. Due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. Nevertheless, because all components of the dehumidifier are in the same room, no heat is removed. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is actually heated, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
