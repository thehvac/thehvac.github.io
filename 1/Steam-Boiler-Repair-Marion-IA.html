<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace at Marion IA?</h3>
<p>Convected heat systems are increasingly popular, particularly in the previous quarter-century as technology has advanced, and the systems have actually shown themselves in dependability and economy.

You ought to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
