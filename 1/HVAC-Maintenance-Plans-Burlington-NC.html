<h3>Air Condition Service Near me in Burlington NC 27215</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage.
