<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn In Your Air Conditioner in Excelsior MN</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his evaluation, guaranteeing I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
