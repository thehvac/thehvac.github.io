<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
