<h3>Effective Tips for Furnace Cleaning in Calhoun LA</h3>
<p>Sean was really handy. He is an extremely enjoyable person to work with. No pressure applied to buy additional things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no issues other than the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>

<p>I usually don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
