<p>Making use of air filters can trap some of the air toxins. The Department of Energy's Energy Performance and Renewable resource area suggests that "Air Filtering need to have a Minimum Effectiveness Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as determined by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are used to decrease the quantity of dust that reaches the damp coils.

<h3>Working of a HVAC System in Mount Pleasant SC</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
