<p>The pollutants listed in this guide have actually been shown to cause the health results discussed. Nevertheless, it is not always true that the results noted occur at the pollutant concentration levels generally found in the house. In most cases, our understanding of the pollutants and their health impacts is too restricted to identify the levels at which the listed results might occur.<p>
<p>Air pollutants can range from contaminants brought in from the outdoors by your family pets to unsafe gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a typical air pollutant arising from gas that leaves into your home without being burned off. Older houses might consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when released into the air. In restrooms and cooking areas, mold and mildew can end up being an annoyance where wetness levels are typically higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Sometimes a short-term indoor air quality issue is produced just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a room or building, such as an overcrowded meeting location. In those cases, a short-term repair might be all that's required, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. However more complicated problems-- determined by consistently unacceptable air quality tracking results-- will need a various tack. Depending upon the issue you're experiencing, one of the three techniques listed below may be suitable.<p>
