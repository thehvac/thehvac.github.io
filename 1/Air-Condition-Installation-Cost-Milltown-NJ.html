<p>EER represents Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more difficult to manage than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity ought to be kept at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
<p>Watch out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, wall, floor, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to two days may end up being a source for mold development and ought to be disposed of. In some cases there is a musty smell however mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can grow in hidden or rarely accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products consisting of carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Fix the moisture problem, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly clean the location using established health department suggestions.<p>
