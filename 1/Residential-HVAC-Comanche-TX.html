<h3>HVAC Repair And You - What You Need to Know in Comanche TX</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even little window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions call for. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Furthermore, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature level, and after that switch it ON. To avoid straining an ac system's compressor, wait at least five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
