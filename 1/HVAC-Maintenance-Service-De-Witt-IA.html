<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
