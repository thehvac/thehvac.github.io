<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized.
