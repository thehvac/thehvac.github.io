<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
