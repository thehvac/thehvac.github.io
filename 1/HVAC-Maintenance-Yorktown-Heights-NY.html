Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need additional cooling to provide thermal convenience inside your home.

<h3>The Operation of the Boiler Burner at Yorktown Heights NY</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  system instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor system. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Many modern-day air-conditioning systems feature a dehumidification cycle during which the compressor runs while the fan is slowed as much as possible citation needed to reduce the evaporator temperature and for that reason condense more water. When the temperature level falls below a limit, both the fan and compressor are turned off to alleviate more temperature drops; clarification needed this prevents moisture on the evaporator from being blown back into the space. citation required When the temperature rises again, clarification required the compressor restarts and the fan returns to low speed.<p>
