<h3>HVAC Systems Are a Must for All Homes and Offices in Portland OR</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>When you have actually got the ideal furnace chose and installed, you're going to need to keep it in great condition. When it breaks, taking care of your furnace does not just involve repairing it. If you desire your furnace to live a long and productive  life, you'll require to set up preventive maintenance for it as well. Having an HVAC technician give your furnace a tune up makes it possible to determine and eliminate potential issues before they grow large enough to adversely impact its efficiency. You need to set up preventive maintenance for your furnace a minimum of as soon as a year.<p>

<h3>HVAC Service Technician in Portland OR 97229</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
