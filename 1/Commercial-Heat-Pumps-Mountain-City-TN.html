<p>HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single household houses, apartment, hotels and senior living centers, medium to large commercial and office buildings such as medical facilities and high-rise buildings, vehicles such as automobiles, trains, ships, submarines and airplanes, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy structure conditions are managed with respect to temperature level and humidity, utilizing fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also might add to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not changed regularly may become blocked, reducing air circulation quality, volume, and distribution. They also might end up being locations for molds and germs to grow and be distributed throughout the home. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also should be properly kept to avoid bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products consist of vinyl asbestos flooring tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement products. These items provide a risk only when they are managed in a manner that creates dust consisting of asbestos fibers which can be breathed in. When asbestos-containing materials are harmed or disturbed by repair, redesigning, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can end up being airborne if correct controls are not in place. This can result in the capacity for considerable health problems.<p>
