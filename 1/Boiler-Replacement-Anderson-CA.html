<p>Examine these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most heaters have several control boards. The largest, or only one in some furnaces, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and control of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the brand-new control panel need to be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t effectively diagnosed, changing a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable as soon as installed. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a pro to identify.<p>
