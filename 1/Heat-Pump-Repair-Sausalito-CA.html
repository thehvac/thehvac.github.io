<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with routine preventive maintenance, though, there will constantly be the odd issue that sometimes comes up. When you do notice your furnace acting oddly, it is very crucial that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as quickly as possible. The faster you respond to problems with your furnace, the much easier they are to repair. Waiting to call for repairs will only make the problem worse, and often more costly.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area. All objects in the hot zone reach stability in temperature after the convected heat system has actually been operating for a while, including people. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>

<h3>Air Conditioner Reviews in Sausalito CA 94965</h3>

The outside condenser unit likewise switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
