<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts years, considering that it is secured indoors. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical standards eliminate the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
