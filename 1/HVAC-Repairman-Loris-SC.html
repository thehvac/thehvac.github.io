<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.. Secondly like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to appropriately service and the unit has actually been operating problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
