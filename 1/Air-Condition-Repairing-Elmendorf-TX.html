<p>SysTech Style focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your home won't heat up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A filthy filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
