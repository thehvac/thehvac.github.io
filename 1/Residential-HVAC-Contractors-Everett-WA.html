<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outdoor system as near to the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
