Structures continuously progress as an outcome of the changes in the environment around them along with the residents, products, and activities within them. The various surface areas and the air inside a structure are constantly interacting, and this interaction leads to changes in each. For example, we might see a window as changing somewhat with time as it becomes unclean, then is cleaned up, builds up dirt again, is cleaned up once again, and so on through its life. In reality, the dirt" we see may be progressing as an outcome of the interactions amongst the moisture, chemicals, and biological materials found there.<p>

<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his workers, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not seem like much, specifically if the objective of owning a business was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it took to build business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't completion goal. HVAC entrepreneur must strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the same in all other locations.<p>
