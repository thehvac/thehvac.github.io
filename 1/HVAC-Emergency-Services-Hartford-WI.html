<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years or so. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Photo 6).<p>

<p>I generally do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over choices. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
