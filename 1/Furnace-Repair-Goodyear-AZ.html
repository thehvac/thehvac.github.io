What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over choices. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold.

Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
