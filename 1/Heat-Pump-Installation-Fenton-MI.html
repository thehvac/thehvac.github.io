<p>Sean was very valuable. He is an extremely enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure used to purchase additional stuff. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was.

If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
