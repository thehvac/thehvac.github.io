<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outdoor  system instead of ducting air directly from the outside unit. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>A fan belt, also called a drive belt, is a belt linking your cars and truck's engine to the front installed devices.
