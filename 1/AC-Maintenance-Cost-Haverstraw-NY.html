<h3>Heater Repair in Haverstraw NY 10927</h3>
<p>I have been using them for several years for my businesses, my own homes and my real estate clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. He helped me trouble shoot the concern when I called and he recommended me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again. He is honest, reputable, and reasonable on price. It's tough to find a sincere AC man and I'm glad I found Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>
