<h3>AC Compressor Repair in Newton Falls OH 44444</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
