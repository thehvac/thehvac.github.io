<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace in Wood River IL</h3>

Their techs are professional and really knowledgeable. Costs are sensible. Always on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff installed a new air handler and condenser today. I did not bother to get rival's quotes due to the fact that of my trust in Waychoff due to the fact that the cost was certainly sensible.<p>
<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a reference later on). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
