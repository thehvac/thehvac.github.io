Investigations carried out in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually found the exact same to be real.

<p>A/c can also be supplied by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
