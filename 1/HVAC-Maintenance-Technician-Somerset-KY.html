Carbon dioxide at levels that are unusually high inside your home may cause occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level thought about appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in most structures.

Due to the fact that it merely takes more electricity to run a bigger system, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed moisture. The outcome is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In fact, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
