<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Allergens are materials that trigger an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these products. Allergens discovered in indoor air are mainly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can become airborne, and hence, are quickly breathed in. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For example, if you think about a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of cat allergen might cause an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergies, however not in those individuals who do not have feline allergies.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
