<p>I generally do not leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about options. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
