<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical product over time.
