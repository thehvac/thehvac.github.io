<p>The use of air filters can trap a few of the air pollutants. The Department of Energy's Energy Performance and Renewable Energy section recommends that "Air Purification need to have a Minimum Performance Reporting Worth (MERV) of 13 as identified by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation needed Air filters are used to reduce the quantity of dust that reaches the damp coils. Dust can serve as food to grow molds on the damp coils and ducts and can decrease the effectiveness of the coils.<p>
<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ problem. Your company should inspect measurements of air, temperature and humidity flow. In addition, assessment and screening of the ventilation, heating and cooling systems (to make certain it is working according to specs for developing use and occupancy) need to be performed. A structure walk-through to look for smells and look for water damage, leaks, dirt or bug droppings might be handy. Leakages need to be gotten rid of. Standing water in humidifiers, air conditioning systems, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can become polluted with germs or fungis and need to be removed, also. In some situations, specific screening for radon or for asbestos may be required as part of building tenancy.

<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things first. Make certain all the signs up in your home are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The decreased airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
