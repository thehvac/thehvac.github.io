What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss choices. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
