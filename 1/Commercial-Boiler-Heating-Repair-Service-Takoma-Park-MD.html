<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. While doing so, heat is taken in from inside your home and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you need to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
