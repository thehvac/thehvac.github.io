<p>Considering that the 1980s, producers of HVAC equipment have actually been making an effort to make the systems they manufacture more efficient. This was initially driven by rising energy expenses, and has actually more just recently been driven by increased awareness of ecological issues. In addition, improvements to the HVAC system performance can also help increase resident health and productivity. 21 In the US, the EPA has imposed tighter constraints over the years. There are numerous methods for making HVAC systems more efficient.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more tough to manage than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material in time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
