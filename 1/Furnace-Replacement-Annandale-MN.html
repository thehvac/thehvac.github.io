<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
