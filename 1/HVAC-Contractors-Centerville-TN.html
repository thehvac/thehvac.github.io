<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power should not go beyond the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems greater than the outside capacity by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to anticipate much better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the same time, because the total capacity of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Put simply, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a method that a few of the spaces might not have a really comfy temperature level. However, the computation of the overall power is not simple, given that it takes into account not just the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
