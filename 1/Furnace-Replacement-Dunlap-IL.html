<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace service technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Radiant heating offers a number of special advantages over forced air heater. For example, radiant heat systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems.

Transmitting heat through solid things will likewise trigger it to last longer than using air as a thermal medium. A home heated by a radiant system will heat up much faster, and stay warm with less energy invested. These are just a few of the lots of advantages that a radiant heating system can provide you.<p>

<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
