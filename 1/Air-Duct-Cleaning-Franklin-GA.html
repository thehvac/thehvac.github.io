I went through 5 other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with various costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. He helped me difficulty shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again. He is sincere, reliable, and affordable on cost. It's tough to discover an honest AC man and I'm thankful I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
