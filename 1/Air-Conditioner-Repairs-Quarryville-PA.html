These convection heating units are still extensively used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash being available in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to use auto debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There must not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
