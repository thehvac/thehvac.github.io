<p>Seattle furnaces can run nine months of the year. Based upon the typical temperatures in our area, if you compared running your furnace to a car it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its expected life-span of 15 years. Your heater will strive for you, but like your car, doing routine and regular maintenance will keep it running smoothly, avoid issues, and keep your guarantee undamaged.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. In time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Prior to that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors altered to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
