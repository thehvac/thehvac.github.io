<p>At present, EPA does not suggest using air cleaners to reduce levels of radon and its decay products. Because they only partially remove the radon decay items and do not lessen the amount of radon entering the home, the effectiveness of these gadgets is unpredictable. EPA plans to do extra research study on whether air cleaners are, or might become, a trusted means of minimizing the health risk from radon. EPA's booklet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, offers further details on air-cleaning gadgets to lower indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them up until they have been properly dried. If goods with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent gos to, try a various dry cleaner.<p>

The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfortable level, improving indoor air quality and making it possible for greater comfort at higher temperatures.<p>

While a space heater is in use, open a door from the room where the heating unit is located to the remainder of the home and open a window somewhat.<p>
