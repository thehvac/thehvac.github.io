<p>While toxins typically found in indoor air are accountable for many hazardous effects, there is substantial uncertainty about what concentrations or periods of exposure are essential to produce particular health issue.

<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material over time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
