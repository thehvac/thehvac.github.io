<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average house.

The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather significant.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
