<p>Immediate effects might appear after a single direct exposure or repeated exposures. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such immediate impacts are treatable and normally short-term. Sometimes the treatment is just eliminating the person's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be recognized.

<p>Next, and perhaps just as important when it concerns central air costs, is the AC unit's size.
