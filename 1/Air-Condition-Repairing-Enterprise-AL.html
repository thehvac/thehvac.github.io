<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>As with many home enhancement tasks, the cost of a full central heater can differ widely based upon the size of the home. Most heaters will last in between 15 and twenty years. In selecting a furnace, property owners should consider heat output and efficiency. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the house. A little home, for example, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the home too rapidly and shut down for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature level levels.<p>
