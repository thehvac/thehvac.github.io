As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The ac system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
