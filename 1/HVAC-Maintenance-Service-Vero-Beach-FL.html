<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't use them.. Secondly like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required skills to do the task and also the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to effectively service and the system has actually been running issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
