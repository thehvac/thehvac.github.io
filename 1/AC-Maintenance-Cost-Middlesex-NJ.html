Buildings constantly evolve as a result of the changes in the environment around them along with the occupants, materials, and activities within them. The different surface areas and the air inside a building are constantly connecting, and this interaction leads to modifications in each. For instance, we may see a window as changing somewhat with time as it becomes unclean, then is cleaned, builds up dirt once again, is cleaned once again, and so on through its life. In reality, the dirt" we see may be progressing as a result of the interactions amongst the moisture, chemicals, and biological materials found there.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a big central air conditioner system that sits outside your house.

This permits them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heating unit (like a space heater) with the same amount of electrical power. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
