He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company several years earlier and understand the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
