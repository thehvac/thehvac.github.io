<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act similar to standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will remove the need to set up a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
