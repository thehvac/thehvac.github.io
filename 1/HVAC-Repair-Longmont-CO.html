<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair in Longmont CO</h3>
<p>One of the primary reasons a furnace will run continuously is due to the fact that something is blocked or filthy Prior to trying to fix any issue, take some time to ensure that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". Examine the furnace blower for clogging and clean it if the air filter is great to go. If this does not work, take a look at the furnace blower motor and lubricate it. If you still can not find out why your furnace keeps running, contact an experienced technician.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
