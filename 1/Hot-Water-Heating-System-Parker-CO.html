<h3>Picking the Right Company For Heating and AC Systems at Parker CO</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field.

From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
