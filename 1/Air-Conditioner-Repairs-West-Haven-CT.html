<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your house that best temperature all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out a few of those common air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not just does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can lead to pricey repairs down the road. So, make sure to change your AC filters regularly, or get an air conditioning service strategy which typically consists of a filter modification - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
