<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that only a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause pricey compressor failure, however a house owner doesn't have the skills or tools needed to examine refrigerant levels.
