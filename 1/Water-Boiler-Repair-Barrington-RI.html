No matter what the kind of home HVAC system, adequate air flow (ventilation), appropriate purification, and humidity control all contribute to a healthy indoor air environment. > Likewise, frequent maintenance of the HVAC system will guarantee that it is running safely and not adding to or triggering an indoor air issue.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
