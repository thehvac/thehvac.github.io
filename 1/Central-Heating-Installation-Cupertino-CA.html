<h3>The Way to Get Your HVAC Certification and HVAC Licensing at Cupertino CA</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between a outdoor and indoor system rather of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
