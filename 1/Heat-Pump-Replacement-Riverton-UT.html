<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
