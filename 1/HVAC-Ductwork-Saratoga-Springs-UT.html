<p>In general, ductless AC systems are more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly than conventional A/cs. Because you can turn off individual spaces when you're not occupying them, this is.

<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
