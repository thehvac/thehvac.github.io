<h3>Floor Heating System in Williamston NC 27892</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy.

The outside condenser system likewise switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
