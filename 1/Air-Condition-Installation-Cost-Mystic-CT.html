<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
