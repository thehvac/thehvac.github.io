<p>Cooling can also be offered by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>

In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
