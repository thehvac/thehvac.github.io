From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a pipe twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet.

You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
