Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the standard hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the standard water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>
