<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn In Your Air Conditioner in Waller TX</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>The bottom line is to safeguard your financial investment by only using the services of a licensed contractor or a licensed agent from a business or retailer to do the installation. If you pick to try to do it yourself, or employ a non-licensed individual to do the work, in a lot of, if not all cases, you will void the warranty for the air conditioning system. A voided service warranty won't do you any great need to the system fail or breakdown. Do it right from the outset and employ a certified person with the experience to install the system.<p>
