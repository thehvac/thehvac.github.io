<h2>How To Hire Affordable HVAC Contractor in Clarkston</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How climate change affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for modern air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c unit boost. This boost has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
