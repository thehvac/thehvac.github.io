<p>An undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run because it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit.

That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary wetness. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
