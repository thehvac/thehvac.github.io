In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the incoming air is reduced, but it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged.
