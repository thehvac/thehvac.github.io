<h3>Electric Heat Pump in New Albany Ohio</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs silently and effectively, but to have 2 major parts fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>In an area where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good main heating systems.

A little house, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the house too quickly and turn off for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature level levels.<p>
