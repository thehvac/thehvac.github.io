<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to assist keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation expenses. Likewise a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can impact this might be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>The first ac system and fridges employed flammable or toxic gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might lead to deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
