<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer auto debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
