Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature in the room when you exist.<p>

<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO maintain the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor sensibly, many of the 'trustworthy' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales tactics that DO make the most of uninformed homeowners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a reputable company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

The lowest efficiency permitted by law for new gas designs is 78%, and there are various alternatives that attain 98%, for near total efficiency.<p>
