<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with routine preventive maintenance, however, there will always be the odd problem that periodically comes up. When you do observe your furnace behaving strangely, it is really crucial that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as quickly as possible. The faster you respond to issues with your furnace, the easier they are to fix. Waiting to require repairs will just make the problem even worse, and typically more pricey.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outdoor system as close to your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
