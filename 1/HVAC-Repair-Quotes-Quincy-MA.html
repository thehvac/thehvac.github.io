<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not provide auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in every month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year.
