<h3>Common Reasons For Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Germantown OH</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by improving airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to secure your financial investment by just utilizing the services of a licensed contractor or a licensed representative from a company or merchant to do the installation. If you select to try to do it yourself, or work with a non-licensed person to do the work, in most, if not all cases, you will void the guarantee for the a/c system. A voided service warranty will not do you any excellent ought to the system fail or malfunction. Do it right from the start and work with a licensed individual with the experience to install the system.<p>
