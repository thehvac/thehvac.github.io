<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ problem. Your employer should check measurements of humidity, temperature and air flow. In addition, examination and screening of the ventilation, heating and cooling systems (to make sure it is working according to requirements for developing usage and occupancy) need to be carried out. A structure walk-through to check for odors and try to find water damage, leakages, dirt or insect droppings might be practical. Leaks need to be eliminated. Standing water in humidifiers, a/c systems, on roofings and in boiler pans can become contaminated with fungis or germs and need to be gotten rid of, likewise. In some situations, specific screening for radon or for asbestos might be required as part of structure tenancy. For instance, in schools asbestos requires to be inspected every 3 years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Threat Emergency Response Act-AHERA).<p>
<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c works but your house does not cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
