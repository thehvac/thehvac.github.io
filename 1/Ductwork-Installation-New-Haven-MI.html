<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
