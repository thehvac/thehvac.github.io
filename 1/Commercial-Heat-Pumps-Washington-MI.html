<p>The impacts of lead direct exposure on fetuses and kids can be extreme. They consist of hold-ups in mental and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Kids, fetuses, and infants are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than adults since lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the destructive effects of lead. Kids might have higher exposures because they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
