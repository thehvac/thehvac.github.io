Combustion products from vehicle exhaust, heaters, hot water heater, area heating units, aromatic candles, oil lamps, wood stoves, fireplaces, and gas stoves that are not properly vented can create carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates.

After that, you can make a much better right choice on how frequently your HVAC filters need replacing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less often you'll have to clean them.
