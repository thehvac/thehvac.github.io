<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical product over time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions.
