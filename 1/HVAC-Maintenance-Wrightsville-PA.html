I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years back and know the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year.
