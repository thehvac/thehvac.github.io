<p>There are many reasons why this can take place. Fortunately is that you can attend to many of these factors by yourself without the need to call for expert help.

You can likewise check the filter to ensure it is clear of dirt and check the standing pilot burner to ensure it is lit.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a hose pipe two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
