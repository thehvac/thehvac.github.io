<p>Cooling can also be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>
