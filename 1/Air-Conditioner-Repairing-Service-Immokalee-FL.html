<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing.

Due to the fact that they only partially eliminate the radon decay items and do not diminish the quantity of radon getting in the home, the effectiveness of these devices is uncertain. EPA plans to do additional research study on whether air cleaners are, or could become, a trusted means of reducing the health risk from radon. EPA's booklet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, offers more details on air-cleaning gadgets to decrease indoor air contaminants.<p>
