<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
