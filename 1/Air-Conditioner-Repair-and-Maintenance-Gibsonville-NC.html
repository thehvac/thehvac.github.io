<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
