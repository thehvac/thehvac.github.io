<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to briefly switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
