<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How climate modification affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern ac system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning system increase. This boost has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners are more effective than room air conditioners. In addition, they are out of the way, quiet, and practical to operate. To save energy and money, you need to try to buy an energy-efficient a/c and reduce your central air conditioner's energy usage. In a typical air-conditioned home, air conditioning takes in more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electrical power annually, triggering power plants to produce about 3,500 pounds of carbon dioxide and 31 pounds of sulfur dioxide.<p>
