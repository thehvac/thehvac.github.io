Purchased a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
