<p>A geothermal heater does not generate its power by burning fossil fuels such as gas, oil, or coal. Instead, it soaks up heat from within the earth. Moreover, a geothermal cooling and heating system utilizes considerably less electrical power compared to a standard electric heat-resistance heat pump. This makes a geothermal heater an attractive solution to cut your carbon footprint, supplying a positive influence on the environment.<p>
<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning unit works but the house does not cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
