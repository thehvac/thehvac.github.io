<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>
