<p>How climate change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern air conditioning unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit boost.

As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
