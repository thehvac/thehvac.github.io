<p>Power Vac America provides commercial, industrial, institutional, marine and residential duct cleaning and HVAC system cleaning services. On Long Island where we are located, as anywhere else, there are reliable contractors and those who are less reliable. With more than 1500 HVAC contractors in our market, around just 10% are qualified to use energy star rebates on brand-new equipment. When a service call is needed, Service contract customers should get higher priority. Long term companies with validated credentials through dept of consumer affairs and bbb, deal peace of mind to the property owner. It is necessary to research and work with quality companies. Price suggests a lot less when you have multiple service headaches.<p>

<h3>Home Air Conditioning Installation in Longs South Carolina</h3>
<p>Trace was the service technician that took care of my semi annual maintenance today. Trace was on time, courteous, and appreciated my home by constantly wearing boot coverings when entering my home. He showed the points of assessment and also advised I have a UV light installed due to a little accumulation of mold accumulating in the air handler, which he completely cleaned up the outside and examined compressor coils along with ensured the wetness discharge tube was clear by using a cleaning liquid and a store vacuum. He also eliminated the leaves that built up inside the interior of the compressor unit and advised an option to prevent it from continuing, which will do.I got a detailed e-mail report of the examination outlining all the electronic measurements and service.Trace is a property to Waychoff's and I highly advise him and Waychoff's for service and installation.<p>

<p>Reinstall the gain access to panel and detach block. Turn on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait on the AC to start (see Be Client at Startup," listed below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan must spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor starts but the fan doesn't. Shut down the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then see and repower the unit if the fan starts. If  it does not, you've given it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
