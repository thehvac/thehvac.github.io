<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
