<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between a outdoor and indoor system instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor system. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Air conditioning system service appointments include a long list of checks in, on and around your devices. Knoechel Heating Company specialists will take a look at things that may be making your AC run inefficiently, such as refrigerant charge. They make certain particular locations of your air conditioning unit are clean, which can also help them run more efficiently. And, they check for security concerns, so your electrical connections, filters and parts of the a/c unit are running properly, helping prevent dangerous circumstances in your home.
