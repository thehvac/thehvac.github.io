The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>I have been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company.

That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with clients and keeps men working. When a sales male comes to your home he is there to sell, that is the only way he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and must not "require" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on.

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based.

Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide must be calibrated often, and outside measurements utilized for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
