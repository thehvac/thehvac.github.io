<p>Next, and perhaps simply as essential when it concerns central air costs, is the AC system's size. A system that is too big will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not have the ability to appropriately cool the home on hot days. Considering bigger systems cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>

The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, providing warm air to private bed rooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
