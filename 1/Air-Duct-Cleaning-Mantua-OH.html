<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company.

<h3>Is Your Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Mantua OH?</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>A good location to start is to compare your oil or natural gas furnace age to the national average. The typical life expectancy of heaters in houses today is in between 16 and 20 years. If your furnace is close to this age or older, you need to start shopping. Searching for a replacement furnace in an emergency does not enable time for you to make your best choice. The majority of people choose to replace their furnace as a prepared house improvement instead of a panic replacement when your furnace is failing or has currently normal lifespan of a warm air furnace will vary based on its operating environment, that's why it is essential to have the system serviced routinely by a qualified technician. They will have the ability to correctly assess the condition of the furnace and make any recommendations.<p>

<h3>Geothermal Heat Pump in Mantua OH 44255</h3>
<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act similar to standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most inexpensive. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Makers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Also they diagnosed the problem and repaired really quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>

<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service contract tries to upsell you every time they pertain to perform regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, even though it was 6 months prior to the current one ended. She didn't require a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
