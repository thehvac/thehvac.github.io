<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the inbound air is lowered, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather substantial if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
