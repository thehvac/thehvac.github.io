We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heater.

We feel that this new system will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
