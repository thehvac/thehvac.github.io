<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present pattern in home building is to lower air leak through cracks and other openings in floorings, walls, and roofing systems.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor pollutants and helps tire them from the house.<p>
