<p>SysTech Style focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
