<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price terrific but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
