<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
