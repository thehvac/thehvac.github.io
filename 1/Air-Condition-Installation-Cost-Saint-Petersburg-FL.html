<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not use automobile debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in each month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to use vehicle debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There should not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control panel should be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home.

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
