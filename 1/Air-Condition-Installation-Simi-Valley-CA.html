Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have actually been properly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up. Try a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
