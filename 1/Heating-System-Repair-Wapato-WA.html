<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
