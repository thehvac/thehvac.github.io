<p>We contacted Elite HVACS on among the hottest days of summertime( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out same day to evaluate situation & decided to opt for them for the work. I am happy to state that not only did we get the central air conditioning going but likewise changed the heating unit which was old. Everyone we spoke to from starting to end were very expert, considerate and the work was very effectively done. I would highly recommend this company.<p>

<p>My eldest son constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I realized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly consider anything else except changing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The sound level is itâ and low $ s terrific on energy saving too.<p>
<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around fixing the issue, all the while explaining whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working appropriately. He had to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
