<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Trane central air conditioners are known for upholding service warranties and offers a basic 10-year guarantee that covers both parts and labor.

Trane items are frequently costlier than other HVAC brand names, however as the old saying goes, You get what you pay for." Trane is thought about a premium brand name that uses exceptional air conditioners, heat pumps, and gas furnaces.<p>
<p>Air contaminants can vary from impurities generated from the outdoors by your pets to hazardous gas leakages.
