For instance, a heat exchanger may fail too soon since the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering early degeneration, leading to fractures and holes. , if that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and protects the part.. a really beneficial outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
