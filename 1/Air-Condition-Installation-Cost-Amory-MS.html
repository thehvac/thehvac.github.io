<p>I usually don't leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
