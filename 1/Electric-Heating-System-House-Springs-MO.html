<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what materials 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest won't come on. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that protect your cooling system from flooding. Among the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a good chance; you might have a water leakage in the attic. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate spoil on rare occasions.<p>
