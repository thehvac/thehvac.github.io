Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
