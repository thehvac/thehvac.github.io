<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me concerning an unusually high expense that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of concern. Ron had spotted the problem area in looking over the costs. He solved the issue in one day, had actually changed the bill to what I thought about fair prior to he called back, understood what may have triggered the issue and had a strategy to insure that it would not occur once again. I have actually thought about All Points a company with stability for the nine years we have used them. This experience confirms that.<p>
<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO preserve the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor sensibly, many of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales tactics that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
