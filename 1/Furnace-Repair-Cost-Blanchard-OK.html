<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Picking the Right Blanchard OK Company For Heating Repair</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his inspection, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>Oil furnaces tend to be greater in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be appropriately vented and cleaned from the furnace regularly. Change the filters periodically and have your ductwork cleaned due to the fact that the soot develops inside the ducts, reducing their performance over time. Anticipate to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
