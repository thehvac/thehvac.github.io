<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
