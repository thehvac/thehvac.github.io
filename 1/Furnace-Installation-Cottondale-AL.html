<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold.

To make up for this, the heatpump system must temporarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
