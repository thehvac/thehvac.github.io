<p>Heatpump are a dream come to life for folks in Seattle. A/c is something that the majority of Seattleites will only utilize moderately, but since heat pumps can offer both heating and cooling through a single system of ductwork, you'll have the best of both worlds!

<p>Allergens are products that cause an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants found in indoor air are mainly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can end up being air-borne, and therefore, are quickly inhaled. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks.

<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product with time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
