<p>I am replacing our High Speed System since of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including three (3) high velocity supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise reuse the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have an alternative for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>There is no easy response, however lots of use the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is probably a much better service.

<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have problems, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
