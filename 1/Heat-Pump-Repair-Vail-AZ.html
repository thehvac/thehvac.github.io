<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most affordable. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Immediate effects may show up after a single exposure or duplicated direct exposures. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such immediate results are treatable and typically short-term. Sometimes the treatment is simply getting rid of the person's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be identified. Symptoms of some diseases, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may also show up soon after exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
