<p>Award Winning Pipes and HVAC Services. Many common building products utilized before 1975 contain asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Typically, considerable releases of asbestos fiber do not occur unless the structure materials are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building remodelling.
