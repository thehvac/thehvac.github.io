<p>The quality of the air inside our houses, schools and work environments matters, especially given that we spend the majority of our lives inside your home. Air conditioning system help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in incredibly humid environments or in cases where the a/c is large, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioner will need more energy to cool your home. A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>

<p>The reality is, air contamination in your house can be just as bad - or perhaps worse - than it is outdoors.

<p>Whatever heater you set up, it's necessary that it's sized properly for your house. Too large and you'll be paying more for equipment and installation than you should. Plus, it will use too much energy for the amount of heat you want produced. If the system is too little, then your house will not be warmed adequately and the system will have to continuously run to try to heat the entire home, which will increase heating expenses.<p>
<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensing Units: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface ignitor) or electronic lighter goes bad, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it shuts down rapidly. This is a very common repair. If your furnace is more than ten years old and youâ $ re having other service done on it, consider having the ignitor and flame sensing unit replaced as preventative maintenance due to the fact that the cost will be less when the technician is currently there and has the furnace opened for repairs.<p>
