The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

When we do any repair, the parts we utilize are supported with a two-year parts warranty.
