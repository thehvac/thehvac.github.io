The temperature of the air produced by the heatpump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it may not feel very hot. Only be worried if your house is not heating up. Nevertheless, if your system does not seem working properly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be a circumstances where you should call in a professional to repair the unit and inspect.<p>
