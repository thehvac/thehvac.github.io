<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that repeated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the same. When the wiring is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly treat and harden-- normally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is unclean, and filters are plugged, and maybe refrigerant is low, it will not be operating at optimal performance and might overheat. This makes they HVAC system work harder, producing a cycle that doesn't end. An overworked system will also cause your energy costs to rise. It's possible that the size of AC system you have is not huge enough for your home. If the system is too small, it will have to work harder and might overheat. Typically, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to install a 5-ton unit for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot house.<p>
