Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the decreased air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil.
