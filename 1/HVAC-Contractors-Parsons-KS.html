<p>Asthmatic kids are especially at threat. EPA estimates that exposure to secondhand smoke increases the variety of episodes and intensity of symptoms in hundreds of countless asthmatic children, and might trigger countless nonasth-matic kids to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition worsened by direct exposure to previously owned smoke each year.
