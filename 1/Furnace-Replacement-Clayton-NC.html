<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price terrific but Mark headed out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
