<p>A geothermal heatpump is one of the most energy effective methods of heating or cooling a house. Counting on a series of liquid-filled pipelines, a house can be heated up in cooler months by condensing and transferring energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperatures found simply a few feet listed below ground. In the summer months, the procedure reverses, thus cooling a home by getting rid of heat. Underground temperature level stays consistent no matter the environment, so geothermal systems provide consistent and trusted heating and cooling.<p>

As a primary step, in April RMI affirmed before the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set stronger indoor guidelines based upon the most recent science for NO2.

<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts decades, because it is safeguarded inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical standards eliminate the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
