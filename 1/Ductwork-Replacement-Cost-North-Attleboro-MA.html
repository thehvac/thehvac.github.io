<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment).

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
