From the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some fundamental maintenance.

<p>These men have been excellent. At a real estate agent, I in some cases require contractors to give me an opinion for what work on a home may cost.
