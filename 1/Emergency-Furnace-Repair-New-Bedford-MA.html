<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his staff members, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, particularly if the objective of owning a business was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to develop the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't the end goal. HVAC business owners should strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the same in all other locations.<p>
