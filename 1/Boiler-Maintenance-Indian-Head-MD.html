Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. He helped me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again. He is truthful, trusted, and sensible on price. It's tough to find a truthful AC person and I'm happy I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
