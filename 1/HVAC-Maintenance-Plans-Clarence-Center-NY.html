<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest won't come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that protect your a/c system from flooding. Among the most typical locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent opportunity; you might have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is likewise a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate spoil on unusual occasions.<p>
