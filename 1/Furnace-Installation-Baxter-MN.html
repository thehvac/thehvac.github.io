<p>While toxin levels from private sources may not pose a substantial health threat by themselves, most homes have more than one source that contributes to indoor air pollution. There can be a serious threat from the cumulative effects of these sources. Fortunately, there are steps that the majority of people can take both to decrease the risk from existing sources and to avoid brand-new issues from occurring.

<p>Cooling can also be offered by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Aside from space heating, the geothermal heating unit can likewise be linked to a device called a geothermal desuperheater. The geothermal desuperheater can recycle the excess heat generated from the ground source heatpump compressor and utilizes it to heat water.
