<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. Connection issues along the line that provides power to your furnace can jeopardize the efficiency of the system. Loose, malfunctioning or missing wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and interrupt service. Part of preserving your furnace involves examining the suggested connections as well as temperature and pressure gauges. Require time to check these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are secure and tight.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your house will not heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
