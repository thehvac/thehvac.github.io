<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets ask for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, a lot of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
