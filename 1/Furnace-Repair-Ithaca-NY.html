<p>All homes need efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has been burnt out from use. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the right temperature. Furnaces that kick on regularly may be due to a filthy filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps an unclean burner.<p>

<p>This is particularly significant, as gas ranges can trigger levels of contamination that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with poorly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by including new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release toxins.) Nevertheless, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is often crucial to figuring out the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such details can in some cases be obtained by requesting copies of air monitoring information from the employer. If keeping track of data is not available, yet a high variety of health signs have been reported, the Union agent should ask for that the employer have air monitoring tests performed. Review of this data might determine potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. However, when impurity concentrations are very low, monitoring information may not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
