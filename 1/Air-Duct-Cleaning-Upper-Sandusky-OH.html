<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce pollutants.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Often a short-term indoor air quality issue is developed simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a space or structure, such as an overcrowded conference area.

However more complex problems-- determined by regularly undesirable air quality tracking results-- will need a different tack. Depending upon the issue you're experiencing, among the three tactics below might be suitable.<p>
