<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everyone can pay for, so many Seattleites should find ways to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in big box shops like Best Buy, package fans and window AC units are snatched up as soon as they're stacked in flooring screens. Seattle may be the last city in the country to face the reality of a cruel, terrible summer season.<p>
<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have issues, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
