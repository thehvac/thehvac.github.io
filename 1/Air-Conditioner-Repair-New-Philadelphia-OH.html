<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps in New Philadelphia OH</h3>
<p>There are numerous reasons this can occur. Fortunately is that you can attend to a lot of these factors by yourself without the need to call for expert help. Start by opening the heat signs up and then move on to inspecting the thermostat settings. Next, inspect the furnace power, reset the furnace or inspect the service door cover. You can also examine the filter to make certain it is clear of dirt and check the standing pilot light to make certain it is lit.<p>
<p>Both must be kept clean due to the fact that an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
