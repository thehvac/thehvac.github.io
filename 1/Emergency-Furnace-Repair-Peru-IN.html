Load computing is described as the Manual J calculation and should be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or unit cost for air conditioning.

Or the ventilation system might not be working as well as it should-- if debris is blocking the outside air intake, for instance, or the filters are polluted or inadequately maintained.<p>
