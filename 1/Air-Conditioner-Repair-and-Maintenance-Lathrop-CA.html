<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

The technician who discussed our options did an excellent job in ensuring we understood the benefits and drawbacks of each option. The service technicians who set up the brand-new system were quick and expert, while taking some time to ensure we understood how the new system worked. In general a very first rate experience.<p>
