<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the visit. They suggested replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost but a quick web search verified WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace quit working.

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wood floor joist system, beneath the wooded subsurface and last flooring surface. This is generally utilized in a second or third-floor  location and benefits from the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber radiant floor heat hydronic system effective, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipelines to direct heat up.<p>
