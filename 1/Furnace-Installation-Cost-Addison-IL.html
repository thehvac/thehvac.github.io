<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
