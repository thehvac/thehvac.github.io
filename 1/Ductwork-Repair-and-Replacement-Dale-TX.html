<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The selection of indoor units has one constraint: their total power needs to not go beyond the capability of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is really common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units greater than the outdoor capability by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate much better performance when all indoor systems are switched on at the exact same time, considering that the total capacity of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outside unit. Put simply, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that a few of the rooms might not have a really comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the estimation of the total power is not easy, since it considers not only the small power of the systems, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you may need a reference in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
