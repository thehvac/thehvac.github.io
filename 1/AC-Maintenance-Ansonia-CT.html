<p>SysTech Style concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Ansonia Connecticut</h3>
<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of visible growth or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not eliminate the mold.

The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and preserve. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
