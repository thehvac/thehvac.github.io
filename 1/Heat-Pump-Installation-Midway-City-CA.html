<p>Oftentimes, if products have actually stopped working to dry out a number of days after the suspected water event, mold growth is suspected within wall cavities even if it is not immediately visible. Through a mold examination, which might include damaging examination, one must be able to identify the existence or lack of mold. In a situation where there is visible mold and the indoor air quality may have been compromised, mold removal may be needed.

<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as crucial as a regular oil change in your automobile. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear.

During high usage months, examine the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
