<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
