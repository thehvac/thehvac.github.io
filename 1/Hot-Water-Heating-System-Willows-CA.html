<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a reference later on). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>

<p>Indoor air pollution originates from a range of sources; the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has actually recognized structure products, furnishings, and mold as serious issues, but much of the danger also originates from burning things. For example, smoking cigarettes or burning wood for heating or cooking can develop contamination in homes that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is a particularly big problem in the developing world.<p>
