<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not use them.  Secondly like prolonged vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to correctly service and the system has actually been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
