These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be changed or washed as conditions necessitate. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Furthermore, really unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
