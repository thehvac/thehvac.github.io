<p>Details supplied in this security guide is based on present scientific and technical understanding of the problems presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional limits developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. The requirements do not require you to change your existing central air conditioning systems, and replacement parts and services should still be available for your home's systems. The "life expectancy" of a central air conditioner is about 15 to 20 years. Makers usually continue to support existing devices by making replacement parts available and honoring maintenance agreements after the new basic goes into impact.<p>
<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more difficulties, because a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each space. However, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>
