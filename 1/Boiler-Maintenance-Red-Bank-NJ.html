As a first step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set stronger indoor guidelines based on the most recent science for NO2.

<p>Through normal usage and the system's presence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioning system may end up being really dirty. These aspects of the equipment are important for effective air conditioning. The technician cleans up all parts, and checks connections to ensure they are safe and secure. The system is charged with refrigerant, and all electronic parts are examineded for proper function and total condition. This is an excellent chance to recognize parts that are used or malfunctioning. When the issue is reasonably minor, changing them to fix the air conditioning might be a lot less costly.<p>
<p>There is no easy answer, however numerous use the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is most likely a much better solution.
