<p>These people have been great. At a real estate agent, I often require contractors to give me a viewpoint for what work on a house might cost. Recently I needed to get in touch with these people two times. They came out quickly and gave me a no nonsense estimate for the work. Even when it was news my customer probably would not want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the honesty. Stability isn't simply their name, it's a company model they take seriously. You people are officially on speed dial. Talk with you soon.<p>
<p>PE firms tend to run with the objective of selling or spinning off a company at some time. This might be through a public offering, a sale to a big organisation in the field, or perhaps a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE firm Ares Management. Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, earlier this year. Audex had actually owned CoolSys for three years before that.<p>
