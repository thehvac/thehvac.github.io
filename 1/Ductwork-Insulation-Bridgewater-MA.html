<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.  Secondly like extended vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential skills to do the job and also the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to properly service and the system has been operating issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<h3>AC Compressor Repair in Bridgewater MA 02324</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule however got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heating system, consider potential effects of indoor air pollution. Follow the manufacturer's directions, particularly directions on the correct fuel and keeping the heater appropriately changed. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is normally an indicator of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While a space heating system is in usage, open a door from the room where the heater is located to the remainder of the home and open a window a little.<p>
