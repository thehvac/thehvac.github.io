<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend used in autos in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12.

For systems requiring only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by numerous people.<p>
