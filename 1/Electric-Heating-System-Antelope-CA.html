Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do decline them until they have actually been correctly dried. Try a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
<p>Heating is also one of the biggest energy consumers in your home, so house owners who might be buying a brand-new furnace should considering replacing it with a more recent, more energy-efficient model to conserve cash and help the environment.
