<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you must examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
