After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance. Sometimes, measured particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
