These examinations exposed that proper ventilation is important in preserving excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Geographically, some areas pay regularly higher earnings for air conditioning tradesmen.

The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 annually.
