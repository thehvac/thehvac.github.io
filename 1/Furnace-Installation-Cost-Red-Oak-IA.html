Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the traditional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>

<p>Geothermal heatpump are extremely effective, due to the fact that ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature is always at a continuous temperature. These systems can obtain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only achieve a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Similar to other types of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE rates just how much heat a system produces or removes (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to produce the heating or cooling result. A lot of ground source heatpump have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for each unit of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, approximately 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>
