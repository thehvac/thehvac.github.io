<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a recommendation later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've switched all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
