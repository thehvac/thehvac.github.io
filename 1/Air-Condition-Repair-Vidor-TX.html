Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
