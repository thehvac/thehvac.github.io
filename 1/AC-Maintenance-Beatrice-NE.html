<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As a primary step, in April RMI affirmed prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set more powerful indoor standards based upon the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor appliances through codes, and after stronger guidelines are set there is a chance to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 ought to be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements used for estimations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors might also be necessary.<p>
