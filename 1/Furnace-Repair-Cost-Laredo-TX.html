<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning unit back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packing product to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, location two 2x4s beneath the box to raise it up and protect it from moisture.<p>
<p>In the middle of the winter season, when the air is bone-bitingly cold, the last thing you desire is a heating system that can't do the job.

At the very same time, however, you want your heating system to be as effective and eco-friendly as possible to keep your costs down and your house warm.<p>

<p>If no impurity sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists. Extreme re-circulation of air causes "stale air" conditions.

When ventilation is not enough to account for an increase in the number of workers in the area, stale air might likewise be an issue.<p>

Local building codes likely specify the amount (and sometimes quality) of outside air that must be constantly supplied in your structures, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Temporarily increasing ventilation paired with correct usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for example, can be helpful in watering down the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>
