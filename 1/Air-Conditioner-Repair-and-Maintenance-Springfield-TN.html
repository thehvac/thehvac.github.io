<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance.

After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
