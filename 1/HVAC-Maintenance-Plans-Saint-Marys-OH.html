Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, really unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
