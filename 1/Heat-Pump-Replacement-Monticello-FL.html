<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the very same.

Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately cure and solidify-- usually 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom flooring.<p>
