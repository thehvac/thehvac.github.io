The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>

Stagnant air has higher levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. Stale air may also be a problem when ventilation is not enough to represent a boost in the variety of workers in the area.<p>
