This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be turned off totally.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate fantastic however Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c works however your house does not cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>

<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
