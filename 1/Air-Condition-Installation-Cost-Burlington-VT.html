<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c works but your home does not cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
