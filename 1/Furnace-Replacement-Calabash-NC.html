<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Employ specialists and treat them well: Motivated, well-compensated experts perform far better work than transient subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success.
