<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of various heater, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by distributing warm water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space.

<p>You're probably hearing the fan motor trying to begin without the boost it requires from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz.

However the chances are excellent that this may work for one cycle, however the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's finest to change the capacitor.<p>
<p>In an area where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good main heating systems.
