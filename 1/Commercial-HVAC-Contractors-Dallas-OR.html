<p>Direct Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and area of toxin direct exposure. An example of time control is setting up floor waxing and removing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday. This allows items to off-gas over the weekend while the majority of the personnel are at house over the weekend. Place control includes moving the contaminant source away from residents or even transferring prone residents.<p>
<p>Numerous indoor air toxins originate from the cooking area. Gas stoves release hazardous impurities, including carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide. Even electric burners produce those exact same contaminants in lower levels, along with other particles that can be easily soaked up into your bloodstream. So, when you're cooking, make sure to turn on your kitchen vents, or open a window to help filter out the air even more.<p>
<p>It is not advised that "regular" occupational direct exposure limitations (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be used to figure out if the basic indoor air quality satisfies a certain standard. Occupational direct exposure limitations listed in health and safety regulations and the Threshold Limitation Worths ® (TLVs) advised by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are meant as a guide to prevent illness or certain impacts (like eye and nose irritation) in industrial situations. These limits might not be proper in office settings or for the house.<p>
