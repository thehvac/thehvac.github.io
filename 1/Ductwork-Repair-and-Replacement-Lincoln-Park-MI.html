<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating systems are still commonly utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>The very first ac system and refrigerators used hazardous or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might lead to fatal accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
