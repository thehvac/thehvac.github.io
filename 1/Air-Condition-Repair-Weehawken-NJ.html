<p>You could update to the greatest performance equipment readily available and still not feel easily cool on hot days. That's because the mechanicals are just part of the central air system. The typical home's ductwork leaks 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your home, according to Pacific Gas & Electric.

<p>I have actually been using them for many years for my companies, my own houses and my real estate clients' homes. I went through five other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again. He is sincere, trustworthy, and sensible on price. It's hard to discover a truthful AC guy and I'm pleased I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
