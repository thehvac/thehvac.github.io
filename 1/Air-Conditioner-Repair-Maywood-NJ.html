<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is taken in from inside your home and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine components. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs dealt with by specialists, see Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
