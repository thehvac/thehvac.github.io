<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical material with time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
