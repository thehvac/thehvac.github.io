<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was type of strange being that package was opened and items might have fell out. But after review of contents we assured it was all intact. The product was exceptionally lite weight and takes some time to apply. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we fixed issues. I would advise this item to anyone who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
<p>Many HVAC systems now have programmable thermostats that permit property owners to control the temperature and set it on a schedule. For instance, you can set the thermostat to reduce the heat when you're not in home to conserve money on the energy expenses and guarantee the system isn't overburdened. An expert technician will examine the thermostat during the annual maintenance to make sure the real temperature level and the temperature level on the thermostat matches. If there's a distinction in the temperature level, the technician needs to examine the thermostat's performance or evaluate the whole HVAC system.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them..
