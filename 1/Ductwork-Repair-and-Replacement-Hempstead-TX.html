<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.
