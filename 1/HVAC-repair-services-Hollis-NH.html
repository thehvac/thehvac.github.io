<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and kids can be serious. They consist of hold-ups in mental and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Children, babies, and fetuses are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups because lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the destructive results of lead.
