<p>Making use of air filters can trap a few of the air toxins. The Department of Energy's Energy Performance and Renewable Energy area suggests that "Air Filtration must have a Minimum Performance Reporting Worth (MERV) of 13 as determined by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation needed Air filters are used to decrease the amount of dust that reaches the wet coils. Dust can act as food to grow molds on the wet coils and ducts and can minimize the efficiency of the coils.<p>

Airborne elements from regular family products and surfaces can lead to formicary rust within your HVAC equipment. Left uncontrolled, these concerns can result in loss of performance and worse, breakdown of component materials and a shorter furnace lifespan With time, essential elements like the heat exchanger, burners or blower housing can begin corroding, leading to decreased performance.<p>
