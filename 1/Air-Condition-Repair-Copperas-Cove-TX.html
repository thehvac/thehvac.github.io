<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
