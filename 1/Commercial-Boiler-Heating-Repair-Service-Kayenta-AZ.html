<p>I have actually been using them for many years for my organisations, my own houses and my property clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with different costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. He helped me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he advised me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working once again. He is truthful, reputable, and sensible on cost. It's hard to discover a truthful AC man and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>

All of his assistants were courteous and diligent. The work website was left absolutely cleared and cleaned up. We would highly motivate others to go right to Berkshire Heating and Air Conditioning for all their heating and cooling needs.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: They were excellent! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially asked for. They fulfilled my requirements completely by providing a professional quote with alternatives, without pushing extra items. The team appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The also immediately followed up with the necessary evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
