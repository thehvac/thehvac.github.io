<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our new furnace and AC unit. The best aspect of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they identified the concern and fixed extremely quickly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>If the AC does not turn off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not release heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place in time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should suffice up until you buy a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an important function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of procedures which results in the supply and elimination of air from inside a structure." Those procedures consist of generating outdoors air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the structure, and moving some part of indoor air exterior. If one or more of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
