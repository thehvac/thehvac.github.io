<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard water heater.
