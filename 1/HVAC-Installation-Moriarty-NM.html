<p>Indoor air quality (likewise called "indoor environmental quality") explains how inside air can impact a person's health, capability, and comfort to work.

Presently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) standards but it does provide guidelines about the most typical IAQ work environment problems.<p>
<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c unit works however your home does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
