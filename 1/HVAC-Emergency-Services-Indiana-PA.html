<p>Medical facility operating theatres, in which air is filtered to high levels to minimize infection threat and the humidity managed to limit client dehydration. Although temperature levels are typically in the comfort variety, some professional treatments, such as open heart surgical treatment, require low temperatures (about 18 ° C, 64 ° F) and others, such as neonatal, reasonably heats (about 28 ° C, 82 ° F). In both convenience and procedure applications, the goal might be to not only control temperature level, but also humidity, air quality, and air motion from space to space.<p>
<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature, and after that change it ON.
