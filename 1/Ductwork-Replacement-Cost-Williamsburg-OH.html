<p>I have been using them for years for my companies, my own houses and my real estate customers' homes. I went through five other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he recommended me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the issue. He is honest, trustworthy, and reasonable on price. It's tough to discover an honest AC man and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
