<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas gets in houses through dirt floorings, cracks in concrete walls and floorings, floor drains pipes, and sumps. Exposure to radon ends up being a concern when radon ends up being trapped in concentrations and structures construct up indoors.<p>

<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as vital as a regular oil change in your automobile. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps contaminants and debris in the air. When every three months, Energy Star suggests changing your filter. During high use months, check the filters at least monthly.<p>
