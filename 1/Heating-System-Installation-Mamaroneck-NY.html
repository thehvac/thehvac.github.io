<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transferred by animals and people; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander.

Contaminated central air handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
