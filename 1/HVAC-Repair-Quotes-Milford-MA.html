<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
