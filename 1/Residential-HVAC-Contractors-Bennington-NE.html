<p>How environment modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for contemporary a/c) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioner boost. This increase has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

Because a system is set up in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
