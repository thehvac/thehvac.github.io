<p>All houses need efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been burnt out from usage. Another possible factor might be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the right temperature level. Heaters that kick on often may be because of an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal concern. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a dirty burner.<p>
