<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
