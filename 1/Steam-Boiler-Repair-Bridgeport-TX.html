<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Contractors in Bridgeport</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace technicians frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Place the solar tank near the standard water heater. Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are available if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank. It is likely that it is supported by the pipes if the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank. Install unions at the tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not need to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed.<p>
