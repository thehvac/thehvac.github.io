<p>In 2011, NASA watched for an air conditioning system to install in their lunar electric rover. They decided they required specialist assistance and consulted various providers. Lastly, after a strenuous choice process, the space agency selected Dometic. We've had a lot of firsts throughout the years, but this customized job provided special challenges for our engineers," said a representative for Dometic. After comprehensive trials in Arizona, where the system had to keep researchers and their devices cool and dry, our technology is now prepared for extra-terrestrial duty.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings via mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is frequently important to identifying the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such information can often be obtained by asking for copies of air tracking information from the employer. If monitoring information is not readily available, yet a high number of health signs have actually been reported, the Union agent must request that the company have air tracking tests performed. Evaluation of this information might identify possibly dangerous sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. However, when contaminant concentrations are extremely low, monitoring data might not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
