<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>

<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Advice For Bentonville AR Home Owners</h3>
