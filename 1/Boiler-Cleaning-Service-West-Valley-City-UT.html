<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heating systems are still widely used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your home will not warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
