<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>While contaminants typically found in indoor air are accountable for many harmful results, there is considerable unpredictability about what concentrations or durations of direct exposure are required to produce particular illness. People also respond really in a different way to direct exposure to indoor air pollutants. More research is needed to better understand which health effects happen after direct exposure to the typical contaminant concentrations discovered in homes and which happen from the higher concentrations that take place for brief periods of time.<p>
<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, a lot of typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly placed or kept evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which may enter neighboring ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and retirement home, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor water fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy people need heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
