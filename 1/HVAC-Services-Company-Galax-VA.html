It's sort of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, but a great deal of contractors out there haven't bothered with it!

<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ may see moldy or unpleasant smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems.

However not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no alternative to excellent building management.<p>
