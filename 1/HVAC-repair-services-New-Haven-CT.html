<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is frequently crucial to determining the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such info can often be acquired by asking for copies of air tracking data from the employer. If keeping an eye on data is not available, yet a high number of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union representative should request that the company have air monitoring tests performed. Review of this information may recognize possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs.
