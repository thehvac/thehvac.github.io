<p>Details supplied in this safety guide is based upon current clinical and technical understanding of the concerns presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring companies. Buildings constantly progress as a result of the changes in the environment around them as well as the occupants, materials, and activities within them. The different surface areas and the air inside a structure are continuously interacting, and this interaction results in changes in each. For instance, we might see a window as altering a little with time as it becomes dirty, then is cleaned, builds up dirt once again, is cleaned once again, and so on through its life. In reality, the dirt" we see might be progressing as an outcome of the interactions amongst the moisture, chemicals, and biological products found there.<p>
