<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
