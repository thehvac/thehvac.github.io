<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller house, which will affect installation expenses. Likewise a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfy. Other factors that can affect this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the rate fantastic but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
