The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings through mechanical and natural ventilation.
