We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to check AC systems even in winter. We wish we had known him then.<p>

<p>Next, and maybe just as important when it pertains to central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, however will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not be able to effectively cool the house on hot days. Thinking about larger units cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air system needs to hold.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, frequently referred to as central air conditioning" or split-system cooling", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts.

This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Learn how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
