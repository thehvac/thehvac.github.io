<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do not accept them until they have actually been effectively dried. If items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
