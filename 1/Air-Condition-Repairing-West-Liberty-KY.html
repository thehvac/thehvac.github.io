<p>As with most house improvement tasks, the cost of a full central heating system can differ widely based on the size of the house. The majority of heaters will last in between 15 and 20 years. In picking a furnace, homeowner should think about heat output and effectiveness. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the house. A small house, for example, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too quickly and turn off for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature level levels.<p>
