<p>Professional heating unit installations. However, even the best-maintained heater will eventually fail. HVAC professionals recommend following this standard rule when deciding whether it deserves purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the rate of a new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than essential.<p>
