<p>Resideo uses a range of energy-efficient Whole-House Ventilation System options for both brand-new construction and retrofit applications. Breathing air contaminants can cause asthmatic and allergic responses, infections and other health problems that involve the lungs, nose and throat. For example, animal felines, caged birds and rodents, and pet dogs can produce other and dander particles that can trigger allergic reactions or asthma signs in some individuals. Pre-owned smoke is also hazardous to people, specifically kids.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a series of different heating systems, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
