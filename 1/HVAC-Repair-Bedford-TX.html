<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise homes bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has watched the single-family home installation business completely flip on its head the last couple of years. Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to approximately 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not just with newbies more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are finally giving in, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a tube twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut off the electrical power open the furnace and extremely carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
