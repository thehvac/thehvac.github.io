<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things first. Make sure all the registers in your home are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
