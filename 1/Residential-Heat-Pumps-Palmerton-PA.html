<h3>Heating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Repairing Needs in Palmerton PA</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of replacing or exchanging air in any area to supply high indoor air quality which includes temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, co2, and other gases. Ventilation removes undesirable smells and excessive moisture, presents outdoors air, keeps interior structure air distributing, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.<p>

<p>The primary health effect associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
