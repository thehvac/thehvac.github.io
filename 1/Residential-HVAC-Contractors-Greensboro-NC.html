<p>We contacted Elite A/C on among the most popular days of summer( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to assess situation & decided to choose them for the work. I am happy to say that not just did we get the central air conditioning going but also replaced the heating system which was old. Everybody we talked with from beginning to end were extremely professional, courteous and the work was extremely effectively done. I would extremely suggest this company.<p>
