Load calculating is described as the Manual J computation and need to be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to providing an installation or system cost for a/c.

Similar to measuring the size of an unit needed based upon BTUs, figuring out the proper size of system for your house also depends on the unit load-- how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan.

Loosen the old AC contactor before removing the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Picture 6).<p>
