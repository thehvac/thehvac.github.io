<p>Indoor air contamination comes from a variety of sources; the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has actually identified building products, furnishings, and mold as major concerns, but much of the risk also originates from burning things. For instance, smoking cigarettes or burning wood for heating or cooking can develop pollution in homes that can threaten the health of those who live there.

A system that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not have the ability to correctly cool the house on hot days.
