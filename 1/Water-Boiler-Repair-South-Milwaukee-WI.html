<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas.

When radon becomes caught in concentrations and buildings build up inside your home, direct exposure to radon becomes a concern.<p>

<p>Additionally, HVAC services typically should pay licensing and certification costs, so be sure to check out the particular HVAC licensing requirements in your state.

<p>There is a required balance in making your choice though as systems with higher AFUE rankings often feature higher cost. So, make sure to choose based upon how typically you will use your heating system, the load that will be placed on it and the frequency with which you plan on having it serviced each year. For the majority of temperate climates with low heating loads in the winter season, having an extremely high ranked heating system is not constantly necessary.<p>
