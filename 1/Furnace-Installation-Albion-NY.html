<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the go to. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a fast internet search validated WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace quit working.
