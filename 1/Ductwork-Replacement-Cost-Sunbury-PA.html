<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't provide off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur in time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should do the trick till you buy a replacement-- which you ought to do soon.<p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, there has been some promotion recommending that houseplants have been shown to reduce levels of some chemicals in laboratory experiments.
