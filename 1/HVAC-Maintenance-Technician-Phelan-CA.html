Older units from the 1970s may be rated 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is squandered throughout the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated process. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting, setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather pricey.<p>

<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they utilize air to exchange heat, in the very same way as a car radiator or normal household air conditioner does.
