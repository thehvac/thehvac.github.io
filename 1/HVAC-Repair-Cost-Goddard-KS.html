The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Once every year to make sure all the systems are working well, you ought to get your HVAC system visually inspected at least. This inspection is an important element of HVAC maintenance.

Because you will have to hunt for alternative heating sources until the system is repaired, that's the last thing you desire. Regular inspection and maintenance likewise helps keep it in good shape and prolongs its life.<p>
