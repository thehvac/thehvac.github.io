Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home.

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
