After 2 years, things started to change. There have actually been awkward sounds. I got it checked and fixed. I am hoping that is the end of the problem. In general, it has been a great experience. Reputable on the whole. Neat operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its appearances in the start. But then realized Air conditioners are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
