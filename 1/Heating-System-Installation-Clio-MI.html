<h3>Duct Cleaning On Your Clio MI Home</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his inspection, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
