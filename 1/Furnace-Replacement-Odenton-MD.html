<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity professional at a big seller who asked not to be called because he did not have approval to speak on the record, it is common for large retail operations to have a team that consistently monitors energy consumption and temperature levels in stores to save on expenses (particularly in the evening) and to alert shop supervisors if temperature levels in the shops change beyond an appropriate range that might prevent consumers from shopping at the shop.<p>
