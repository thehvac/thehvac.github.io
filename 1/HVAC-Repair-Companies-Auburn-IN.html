<h3>Comparing Commercial Boilers to Residential Boilers at Auburn IN</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by improving airflow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, determined particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
