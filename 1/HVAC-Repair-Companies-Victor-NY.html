<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace professionals typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Reality: Federal and local rewards usually total up to between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can often make the preliminary cost of a system competitive with standard equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capacity, throughout new construction (houses typically utilize in between one and five lots). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot. However, new installation practices are decreasing expenses, to the point where the price is getting closer to traditional systems under the best conditions.<p>
