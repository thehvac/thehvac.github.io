<p>Right now, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, construction debris, and mold might be living in your home's air ducts, impacting the air you breathe along with the performance of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a hazard to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a recent study by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground. But much of the things people do-- or don't do-- can add to the stew of air-borne impurities in their homes and get worse asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>Radiant heat provides a number of special advantages over forced air heater. For instance, radiant heating systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems.

Transmitting heat through solid objects will also cause it to last longer than using air as a thermal medium. A home heated by a radiant system will heat up faster, and stay warm with less energy spent. These are just a few of the numerous benefits that a radiant heat system can provide you.<p>

<p>A specialized a/c that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, however differs from a standard ac system because both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the same air path. A standard ac system transfers heat energy out of the room since its condenser coil releases heat outside.

Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the room is really warmed, simply as by an electric heater that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
