<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor system as near to your home as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
