<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

<p>We're spending a lot more time inside your home, nowadays. While many people presume pollution is simply an outside problem, your house (and office) can also be polluted.
