<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not use them.. Secondly like extended vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to treat clients relatively. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to correctly service and the unit has been operating problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
