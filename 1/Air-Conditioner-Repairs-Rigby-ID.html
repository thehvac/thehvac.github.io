<h3>Electric Heat Pump in Rigby Idaho</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the see. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive however a quick internet search verified WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning.
