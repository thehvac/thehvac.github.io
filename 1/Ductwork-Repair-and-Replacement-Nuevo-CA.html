<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning unit back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s underneath package to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>

This does not seem like much, especially if the objective of owning a service was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it required to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% typically isn't the end goal.
