<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or lab environments, as opposed to industrial or outdoor settings. In tasks where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

<p>Geothermal heatpump can be easily incorporated with existing systems such as standard forced air or glowing flooring heating or can be installed in a brand-new structure. Forced air systems will need a water-to-air heatpump while hydronic radiant heat systems will require water-to-water heatpump. The size of geothermal heat pump and the size of ground loop required depends on the heating and cooling requirements for your house and is critical iin ensuring the performance and efficiency of the system. Capacity for geothermal systems is measured in loads. Normally, a 3-ton setup should be sufficient for the typical house, but home size, heating and cooling requirements, local geology and soil, and land accessibility are all aspects which will influence the appropriate size for your specific home. Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heatpump installation and can help you properly size a system.<p>
