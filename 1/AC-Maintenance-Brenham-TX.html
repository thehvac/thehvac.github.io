Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy.
