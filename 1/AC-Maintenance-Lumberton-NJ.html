<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets requests for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, a lot of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
