<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather considerable.<p>
