<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
