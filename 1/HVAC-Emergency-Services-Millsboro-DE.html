<p>Using a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly decreases exposure to pollutants during cooking. Incorrect adjustment, frequently shown by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. If you buy a new gas stove or variety, consider buying one with pilotless ignition due to the fact that it does not have a pilot light that burns continuously. Never ever utilize a gas range to heat your house. When the fireplace is in use, always make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
