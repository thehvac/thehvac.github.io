Setting up a multi-split system produces more troubles, since some of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each space. However, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems run separately from each other.<p>
