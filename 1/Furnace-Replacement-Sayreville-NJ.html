<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
