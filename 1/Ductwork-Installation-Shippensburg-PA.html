<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
