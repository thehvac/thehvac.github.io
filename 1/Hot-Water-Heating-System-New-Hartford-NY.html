<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy.
