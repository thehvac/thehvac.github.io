We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had problems with air bubble pockets.
