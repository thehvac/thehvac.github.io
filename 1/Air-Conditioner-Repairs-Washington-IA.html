<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was really valuable in gathering information on the phone and providing clear directions about how to temporarily cope with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and used clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely utilize Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
