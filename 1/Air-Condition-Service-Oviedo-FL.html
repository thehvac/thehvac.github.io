<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't provide them..

Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential skills to do the task and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to properly service and the system has been running problem free for the previous 2+ years.
