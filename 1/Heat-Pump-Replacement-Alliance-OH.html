Maintenance of appropriate temperatures and humidity levels and appropriate air flow will help to decrease the occurrence of upper respiratory signs, and, perhaps, skin rashes.<p>
<p>Airborne irritants are merely a reality of life. Molds can cause flare-ups of allergic reaction symptoms, and in some cases, trigger asthma attacks. Bacteria, infections, and germs likewise can live in the air you breathe every day. These airborne contaminants can affect your home convenience devices, too.

<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your house that best temperature level all year round.

Not just does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it likewise wears down your AC system, which can cause costly repairs down the road.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid figure out the effectiveness of dilution.

There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A typical aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
