<p>Another approach to reducing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your home is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming inside. Most home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window air conditioner with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or cooking area fans that tire outdoors get rid of impurities straight from the room where the fan is located and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
