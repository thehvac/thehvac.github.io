<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

<h3>Facts All Sallisaw OK Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by improving airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you must check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
