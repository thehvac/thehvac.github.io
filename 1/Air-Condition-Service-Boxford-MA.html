<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
