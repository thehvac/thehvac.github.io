<p>They were fantastic! Many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially requested. They met my requirements totally by supplying a professional quote with choices, without pushing additional products. The team appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also quickly followed up with the necessary evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>
<p>Central air is a luxury not everybody can pay for, many Seattleites should discover ways to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in huge box shops like Best Buy, package fans and window AC units are nabbed up as soon as they're stacked in flooring displays. Seattle might be the last city in the country to deal with the reality of a terrible, cruel summer season.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service agreement tries to upsell you every time they come to carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, despite the fact that it was 6 months prior to the present one ended. She didn't need a air purification system, however they talked her into it.<p>
