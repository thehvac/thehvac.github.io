<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your house that best temperature level all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing some of those common air toxins. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can cause pricey repairs down the road. So, make certain to change your AC filters regularly, or get a cooling service strategy which typically consists of a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating enough outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
