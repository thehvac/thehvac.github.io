<p>I admit I have not done the mathematics lately, however I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular assessments. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the system sits. I feel like they offer me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that assurance.<p>
<p>Space a/c include a thermostat sensing unit, situated behind the control board, which determines the temperature level of air entering the evaporative coil. The air conditioner might cycle continuously or behave unpredictably if the sensing unit is knocked out of position. The sensing unit must be near the coil however not touching it; adjust its position by thoroughly flexing the wire that holds it in place.<p>
