This is far more cost-efficient on a smaller scale. Bigger remodellings like additions to a home may appropriate for a bigger scale and more pricey hydronic system.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have actually found them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was needed and renovated the entire plenum and the duct work for the water heater since the technicians thought they simply didn't appear best and they could not leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold.

To compensate for this, the heat pump system must momentarily change back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
