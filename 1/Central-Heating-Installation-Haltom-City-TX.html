<p>A packaged unit, typically set up on the roofing system, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, but it is also an option for homeowners to consider. Many times, these systems include not just the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those looking to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system independently, given that the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are normally only readily available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity.
