Your furnace has numerous parts that can affect the health and wellness of you and your loved ones. Having a total check of your furnace will provide guarantee that it is safe to operate. Apotheosis Heating & House Convenience Solutions Combustion Optimization & Safety Evaluation of your furnace includes a Health & Security Analysis, which inspects the heat exchanger (carbon monoxide leaks and contaminated breathing air), checks the pilot security (explosion danger), checks the high limit (fire threat) and consists of a visual assessment for other threats. In reality, our Safety Inspection includes ten separate safety checks of your system.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system parts, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>
