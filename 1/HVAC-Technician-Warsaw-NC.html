<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's an obscure truth that the quality and cleanliness of your air ductwork is simply as important as your HVAC system. Dust and gunk will often build up in ductwork, limiting airflow. Because ductwork is so complicated, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can appear very challenging in the beginning, requiring specialized tools, equipment, and knowledge. When you opt for Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you won't have to fret about a thing.<p>
<p>More common in fairly older houses, a boiler-based heating system uses electricity, oil or gas to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in specific rooms. All-electric boilers can accomplish approximately 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers should achieve 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers need to achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
