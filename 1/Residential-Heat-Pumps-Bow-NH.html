The Guideline banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>

<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden flooring joist system, underneath the wooded subsurface and final floor surface. This is normally used in a 2nd or third-floor  area and benefits from the floor joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber glowing flooring heat hydronic system effective, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipelines to direct heat upward.<p>
