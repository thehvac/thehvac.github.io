Nevertheless, exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible most of the times, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the released spores.

<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, supplying warm air to individual bed rooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
