<p>Right now, countless allergen, dead skin cells, construction debris, and mold may be living in your house's duct, affecting the air you breathe as well as the efficiency of your heating and a/c system. There are a number of style techniques in usage today; nevertheless, all ground source heat pumps operate with similar principles. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface systems and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These different heat sources also dictate the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat utilizing a closed loop.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a large central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outdoors your home. Heat pumps run on electrical power and work like a/c unit in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This permits them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a basic electric heating unit (like an area heating system) with the same quantity of electricity. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more difficult to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity needs to be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the like geothermal energy though, and the two need to not be puzzled. Where a geothermal HVAC take advantage of the heat inside the earth for space heating, cooling or for heating one's supply of water, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is used for creating power in the form of electrical power. The two operations use different processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated to boiling point to accomplish its objectives.<p>
