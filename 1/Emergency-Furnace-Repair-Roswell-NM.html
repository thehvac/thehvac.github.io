And, all of the money you pay your energy utility companies monthly might be used to help you pay for a brand-new, a lot more energy-efficient and energy conserving furnace.

Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is actually warmed, just as by an electric heater that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
