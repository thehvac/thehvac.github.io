<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO maintain the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor sensibly, a number of the 'credible' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales techniques that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a reliable company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a comparable score are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heating unit, consider potential impacts of indoor air contamination. Follow the producer's directions, especially directions on the correct fuel and keeping the heating system properly adjusted. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is typically an indicator of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While a space heating system remains in use, open a door from the space where the heating system lies to the rest of the home and open a window a little.<p>
