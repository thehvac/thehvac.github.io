<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step.
