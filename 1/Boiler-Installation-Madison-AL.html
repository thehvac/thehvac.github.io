<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance items that only an experienced HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can lead to costly compressor failure, but a homeowner does not have the tools or abilities necessary to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and appropriate air flow are essential to a well-functioning system, but homeowners lack the necessary equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still needed to have an expert technician examine the system periodically.<p>
