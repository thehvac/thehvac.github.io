<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered with a Hartsdale NY HVAC Company</h3>
<p>I was really happy in the beginning because things ran smoothly without any noise. Additionally, I saw noticeable changes in my electricity costs. After two years, things started to change. There have been uncomfortable sounds. I got it repaired and inspected. I am hoping that is the end of the concern. In general, it has been an excellent experience. Dependable on the whole. Neat operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its looks in the start. But then understood Air conditioners are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
