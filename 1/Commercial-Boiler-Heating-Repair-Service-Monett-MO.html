<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation.

There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this.
