<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have concerns, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
