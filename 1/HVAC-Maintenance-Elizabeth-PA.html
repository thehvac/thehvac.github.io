<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. A ductless system has a built-in effectiveness advantage because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leaks in your ducts. Since they do not require any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions. Because an unit is set up in each room or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>
