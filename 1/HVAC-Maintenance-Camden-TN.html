<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have issues, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
