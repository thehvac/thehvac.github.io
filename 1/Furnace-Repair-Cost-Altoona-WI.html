<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit contaminants.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>The steadiness of the market's growth doesn't necessarily translate to the experience of operating an HVAC company.
