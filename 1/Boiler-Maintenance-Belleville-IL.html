<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<h3>Heat Pump Prices in Belleville IL 62226</h3>
<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act just like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. A ducted heatpump system may be most economical if your home or building has an existing duct system that remains in good condition. Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
