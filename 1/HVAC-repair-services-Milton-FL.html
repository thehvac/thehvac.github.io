<p>My oldest kid always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him however then I understood that it actually didnÃ¢ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. WeÃ¢ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnÃ¢ $ t truly think of anything else other than changing it. The one I got deserves every cent. The noise level is itÃ¢ and low $ s great on energy saving too.<p>
