<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He knew just what the issue was and repaired it extremely rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also regulating the temperature of the flooring. All circuitry for your radiant heat system either runs to it or from it. Most people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the location is unobstructed and dry.<p>
<p>Ask about training and certifications. A great place to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) certification. It's kind of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there haven't bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by searching for Building Efficiency Institute (BPI) certification. Supervisors with BPI accreditation understand that the house is a system and see HVAC equipment as simply one aspect (out of many) of a comfortable environment.<p>
