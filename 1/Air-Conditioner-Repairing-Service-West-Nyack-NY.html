<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everybody can afford, a lot of Seattleites need to discover ways to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service.

<p>Central air conditioners, frequently described as central air conditioning" or split-system air conditioning", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the floorings, walls, or ceilings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning unit to the home. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Discover how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
