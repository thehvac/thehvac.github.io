<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outside system as near your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
