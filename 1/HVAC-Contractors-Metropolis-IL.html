A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine components. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs dealt with by specialists, go to Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
