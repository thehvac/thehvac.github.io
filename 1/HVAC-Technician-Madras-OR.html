<p>In more complex plans, warm air is enabled to stream and rise out high structure openings to the outside (stack impact ), causing cool outside air to be drawn into low building openings. Natural ventilation schemes can utilize extremely little energy, but care needs to be required to ensure convenience. In warm or humid environments, maintaining thermal convenience entirely through natural ventilation might not be possible. Air conditioning systems are used, either as backups or supplements. Air-side economizers also use outside air to condition areas, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and disperse cool outdoor air when proper.<p>
