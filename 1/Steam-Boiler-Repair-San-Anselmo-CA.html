<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
