<p>Allergens are materials that trigger an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Allergens found in indoor air are primarily biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can become air-borne, and therefore, are quickly breathed in. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the presence of cat irritant might cause an asthma attack in people with cat allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should momentarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
