<p>Chemical toxins: Unpredictable organic substances ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are various, varied, and ubiquitous. They consist of both human-made and naturally happening chemical substances. Chemical contaminants can include tobacco smoke, emissions from products used in the building (e.g., workplace devices; floor, furnishings and wall coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer products) accidental spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
