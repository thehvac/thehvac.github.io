<p>Routine maintenance keeps a furnace working efficiently, according to HVAC professionals like Dave Mejean of B&W Pipes & Heating in Indianapolis. When you're running an HVAC company, you're on board for all the ups and downs that come with owning a high-demand, seasonal service. A thoroughly crafted company plan for an HVAC company is the first step to manage those lulls and peaks so your profits stay healthy year-round.

<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you might not have an issue as long as your home still heats to the ideal temperature level. The temperature of the air produced by the heat pump will not necessarily be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it may not feel extremely hot. Only be concerned if your home is not warming up. However, if your system does not appear to be working properly, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you ought to contact a professional to check and repair the system.<p>
