<p>How climate modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for contemporary air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system boost. This boost has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
