The air was cooled, and thus the amount of moisture in the air might be managed, which in turn made the humidity in the room manageable. The controlled temperature and humidity helped preserve constant paper dimensions and ink alignment.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is soaked up from indoors and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>After the system has been looked for leaks, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside need to be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
