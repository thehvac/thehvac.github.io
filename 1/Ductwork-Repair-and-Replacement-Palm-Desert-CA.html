The company began in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature customers for decades, up until the mandate for high-efficiency systems forced Goettl to end production.

<p>Excellent Item! Delivery was kind of unusual being that package was opened and products might have fell out. But after review of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The product was incredibly lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we resolved issues. I would recommend this item to anyone who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
