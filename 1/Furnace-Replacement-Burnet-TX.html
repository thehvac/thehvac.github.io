I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He assisted me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again. He is honest, trusted, and sensible on price. It's hard to discover a sincere AC person and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>

He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call service several years earlier and know the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year.
