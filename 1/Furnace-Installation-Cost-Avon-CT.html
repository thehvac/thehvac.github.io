<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
