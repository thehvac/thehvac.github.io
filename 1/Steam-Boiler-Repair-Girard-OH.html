<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
