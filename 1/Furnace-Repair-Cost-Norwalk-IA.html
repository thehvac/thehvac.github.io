<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in lots. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it indicates the quantity of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>The installation was quickly, professional and extremely well done. The installers were respectful and knew exactly what to do.
