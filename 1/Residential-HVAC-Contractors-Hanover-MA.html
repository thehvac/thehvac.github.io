<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices generally lasts years, because it is secured inside. When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical guidelines get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
<p>I am very impressed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years ago and understand the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise amazed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
