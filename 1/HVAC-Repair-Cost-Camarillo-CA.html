<p>Lead has actually long been acknowledged as a harmful toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " number one environmental threat to the health of kids in the United States." There are lots of ways in which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, degrading paint, and dust.

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on.

Before that happens, you wish to get those capacitors changed to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system also may add to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced regularly may end up being clogged, decreasing air circulation volume, quality, and distribution. They also might end up being locations for molds and bacteria to grow and be dispersed throughout the house. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems likewise must be properly maintained to prevent germs and mold contamination.<p>

Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating enough outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
