<p>Reinstall the gain access to panel and detach block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait on the AC to begin (see Be Patient at Startup," listed below). The compressor ought to run and the condenser fan should spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor starts but the fan doesn't. Shut down the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Reinstall the blade and protect the cover. Then repower the system and see if the fan starts. If  it does not, you have actually given it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
