<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you ought to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
