<p>If your central air conditioning conditioner will not cool but you can hear it running, it might just need to be cleaned. Whether or not this is the cause of the problem, it's a great early remedy to attempt. Strategy to do this on a relatively warm day. Never use a power washer for this-- it can harm the fins.
