The fluid distributes around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>
