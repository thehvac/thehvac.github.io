<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and children can be serious. They consist of hold-ups in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, children, and babies are more susceptible to lead exposure than grownups given that lead is more quickly soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more conscious the damaging results of lead. Kids may have higher direct exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>

<h3>How Can Air Heat Pump Works in Evans CO?</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix used in autos in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this kind of application, however is still imported and can be purchased and utilized by qualified HVAC technicians. For systems requiring just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by many people.<p>
