Zones are controlled by numerous thermostats. In water heating unit the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the flow of air.

<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works but the house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
