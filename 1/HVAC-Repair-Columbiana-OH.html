<h3>Commercial Heat Pumps in Columbiana OH 44408</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
