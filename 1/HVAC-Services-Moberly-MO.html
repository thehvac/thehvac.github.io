The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash being available in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
