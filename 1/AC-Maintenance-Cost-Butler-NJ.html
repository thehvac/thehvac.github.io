<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c unit works but the house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
