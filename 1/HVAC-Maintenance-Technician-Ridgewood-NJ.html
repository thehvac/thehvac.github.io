Flip the cooling service and furnace circuit breakers in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the detach block (Image 1) and clean the condenser coils (Image 2). If the a/c service still does not work effectively after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs.

In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location.
