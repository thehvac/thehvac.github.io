<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
