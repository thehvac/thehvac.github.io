<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, however it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your house will not warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter.
