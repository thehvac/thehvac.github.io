<h3>Air Condition Service Near me in West Hempstead NY 11552</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
