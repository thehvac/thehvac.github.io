<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Proper Duct Sealing in Bear DE</h3>
<p>Sean was very handy. He is a very enjoyable person to work with. No pressure applied to purchase extra stuff. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no problems besides the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
