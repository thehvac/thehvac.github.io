<p>Great Item! Shipment was sort of unusual being that package was opened and products could have fell out. However after review of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The product was exceptionally lite weight and takes time to use. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we fixed concerns. I would recommend this item to anyone who's renovating or installing their restroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
