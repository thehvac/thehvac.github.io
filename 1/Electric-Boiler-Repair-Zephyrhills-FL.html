For instance, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it means the quantity of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio.

<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
