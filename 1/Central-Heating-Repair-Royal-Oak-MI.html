<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for modern a/c) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c unit increase. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
