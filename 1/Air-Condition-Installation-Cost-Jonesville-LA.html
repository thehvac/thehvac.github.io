<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to run because it has to run longer than a properly sized system. An oversize compressor also costs more to operate since it just takes more electrical power to run a bigger system. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential wetness. The outcome is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In truth, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
