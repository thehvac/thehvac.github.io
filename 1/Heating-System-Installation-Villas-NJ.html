<h3>Electric Heating Systems in Villas NJ 08251</h3>
<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
