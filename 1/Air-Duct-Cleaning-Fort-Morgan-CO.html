<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the task based only on e-mails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few affordable ones received. Others were nearly two times the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex properly advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install group was respectful of my home and installed the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post install inspection outcomes look great for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 heap R22 system it replaced (also Carrier).<p>

Convection is the process of heating air and blowing it about the spaces for the warm air to keep the ceilings, walls and floors heated. In turn, the objects in the room, like furnishings and individuals, would stay warm by virtue of the air temperature level.<p>
