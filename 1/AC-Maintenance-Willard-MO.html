<h3>Why Fall Is the Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Willard MO</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heater. We picked getting something more expensive than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest utility costs. We feel that this new system will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
